# Capstone Project: Legal Text Analytics with Large Language Models

This project explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs to enhance legal text analytics, focusing on food safety-related cases in India (2022â€“2023). The methodology and results demonstrate how these techniques can automate summarization, entity extraction, and corpus-level analysis of legal texts.

## Introduction

- **Background**: Legal text analysis is complex, requiring tools to handle large corpora efficiently. LLMs can extract and summarize legal entities but lack corpus-wide context, addressed by combining them with Knowledge Graphs.
- **Objectives**:
  - Automated summarization of legal documents.
  - Extraction of key legal entities like statutes, provisions, and case participants.
  - Creation of a Knowledge Graph to represent and analyze entity relationships.
  - Executing meaningful queries to extract corpus-level insights.

## Dataset

A corpus of 196 Indian court cases on food safety was collected, filtered, and preprocessed. Minimal preprocessing was applied to retain document integrity.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Used web scraping tools to gather and clean data.
- **Knowledge Graph Design**: Modeled legal concepts and relationships, emphasizing statutes and provisions.

- **Entity Extraction**:
  - Traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) models.
  - LLM-based extraction using structured prompts.
- **Summarization**: Generated concise, accurate document summaries using GPT-4o-mini.
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Populated and queried a Neo4j graph database to identify patterns and trends.

## Results

- **LLM Performance**:
  - Compared LLM and NER models for entity extraction. LLMs demonstrated better generalizability but with mixed precision.
  - Summarization was assessed using BERT and ROUGE-L metrics.
- **Knowledge Graph Insights**:
  - Most frequently cited provisions and related case clusters were identified.
  - Advanced queries revealed relationships between cases using Jaccard similarity and shared citations.

## Conclusion and Future Work

- **Limitations**: The dataset scope and reliance on graph query languages limit accessibility.
- **Future Work**:
  - Expand datasets for broader trends and insights.
  - Enhance graph relationships to capture more nuanced legal contexts.
  - Develop a natural language querying interface for user-friendly interactions.
