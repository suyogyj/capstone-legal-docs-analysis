8_vs_Wood_Craft_Products_1995_on_21_February_2015.PDF,"Case overview
The case involves an appeal by M/s. Parisons Foods Pvt. Ltd. against a Clarification Order issued under Section 94 of the Kerala Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (KVAT Act). The appellant sought clarification on the tax rate applicable to 'bakery shortening', which they argued should be taxed at 5% under Entry 38 of the Third Schedule of the KVAT Act. The Department contended that 'bakery shortening' did not fall under Entry 38 and should be taxed at a higher rate under a residual entry.

Key facts
- The appellant is engaged in the manufacture of 'bakery shortening'.
- The Department argued that 'bakery shortening' is not covered under the specific Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) Code for Entry 38(18)(d), which includes 'vanaspati'.
- The Clarification Authority determined that 'bakery shortening' is subject to a tax rate of 12.5/13.5/14.5% under the residual entry of S.R.O. No. 82/2006.

Legal issues and arguments
- The appellant argued that 'bakery shortening' falls under HSN Code 1516, specifically under sub-heading 1516.20.91, which is classified as 'vanaspati', and should be taxed at 5%.
- The appellant contended that the Clarification Authority relied on a judgment that ignored a contrary decision from a co-ordinate Bench of the same Tribunal.
- The appellant cited definitions from the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act) to argue that 'bakery shortening' is essentially 'vanaspati'.
- The Government Pleader argued that 'bakery shortening' is a product derived from further preparation of 'vanaspati', thus classifying it under HSN Code 1517, which pertains to mixtures or preparations of fats and oils.

Court's reasoning
- The court examined the definitions of 'vanaspati' and 'bakery shortening' under the FSS Regulations and the Vegetable Oil Products Regulation Order, noting that they are defined separately.
- The court emphasized that the HSN codes must be interpreted based on the specific descriptions provided in the KVAT Act and the Customs Tariff Act.
- The court found that 'bakery shortening' undergoes a preparation process that takes it out of the classification under HSN Code 1516 and places it under HSN Code 1517.
- The court referenced the manufacturing process of 'bakery shortening', which involves blending and further preparation, indicating it does not retain the characteristics of 'vanaspati'.
- The court concluded that the inclusion of 'vanaspati' in the entry does not extend to products derived from it through further preparation.

Decision or judgment
The court upheld the order of the Clarification Authority, concluding that 'bakery shortening' does not fall under Entry 38(18)(d) of the KVAT Act and is subject to taxation under the residual entry. The appeal was dismissed with no costs.",High Court of Kerala,['M/S.PARISONS FOODS PVT.

- The respondents maintained that the milk was indeed sub-standard and that the appellant failed to challenge the Food Analyst's report, which constituted an admission of guilt.

Key facts
- The petitioners include a vendor (Ardor Restaurant) and suppliers and manufacturers of the food article in question. 
- A sample of 'Chilli Sauce' was taken by the Food Safety Officer (FSO) on 14 June 2012, which was found to be misbranded due to lack of nutritional information as required by the Food Safety & Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011. 
- The Adjudicating Officer imposed a penalty of ₹1,00,000 on each petitioner for violating the FSS Act. 
- The Tribunal upheld the penalty for non-declaration of nutritional facts but absolved the petitioners of another alleged violation.

Arun_Hanumant_Pannde_And_Another_vs_The_State_Of_Maharashtra_on_4_March_2016.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves multiple Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications filed against the State of Maharashtra regarding violations of food safety regulations, specifically concerning the transportation and sale of Gutka and Pan Masala. The judgment was delivered by Justices A.V. Nirgude and Indira K. Jain on March 4, 2016.

Key facts
- The petitioners were found transporting large quantities of Gutka and Pan Masala, which were prohibited under a government notification dated May 15, 2014. The Food Safety Officer seized the goods and lodged a police complaint against the petitioners for violations under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act, 2006) and various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
- The petitioners argued that the police complaint and registration of crimes under IPC were illegal, particularly contesting the applicability of Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 of the IPC.

Legal issues and arguments
- The main legal issue was whether the actions taken by the police against the petitioners were justified under the IPC or if they should have been addressed solely under the FSS Act, 2006.
- The petitioners contended that the FSS Act provides a comprehensive framework for food safety violations and that the police should not have intervened under IPC provisions, especially since the contraventions did not warrant criminal prosecution.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the FSS Act, 2006 empowers the Food Safety Commissioner to prohibit the sale and distribution of certain food items in the interest of public health. The petitioners were found in violation of this prohibition.
- The court emphasized that the FSS Act provides specific procedures for enforcement and adjudication of food safety violations, which do not include criminal prosecution under IPC unless the violations are serious and warrant imprisonment.
- The court found that the contraventions committed by the petitioners were subject to penalties under the FSS Act and should be adjudicated by designated officers rather than through criminal proceedings.
- The court also highlighted that the items in question had not been subjected to food analysis to determine if they were adulterated or unsafe, which is necessary to apply IPC provisions related to food adulteration.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications, declaring the actions taken by the police against the petitioners under IPC Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 as illegal and quashed the complaints.
- The court clarified that the Food Safety Officers retain the authority to proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act, 2006.","High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad","['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.

Arun_Kumar_Jindal_vs_Sh_R_P_Singh_on_15_February_2020.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is Arun Kumar Jindal vs Sh.R.P.Singh, adjudicated on 15 February 2020 by Sh. Dinesh Kumar Sharma, District & Sessions Judge/Food Safety Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi.
- The appellants are Arun Kumar Jindal and M/s Bengali Sweets Corner, while the respondent is Sh.R.P.Singh, Food Safety Officer.
- The appeal (FSAT No. 33/2016) challenges an order dated 02.09.2015 from the Adjudicating Officer, which imposed a penalty for violations of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act).

Key facts
- On 23.03.2013, a sample of Khoa was purchased from the appellants by the Food Safety Officer, who found it stored for human consumption.
- The sample was taken under the supervision of a witness, and the Khoa was found to be substandard due to exceeding the maximum limit for BR value and a positive Baudouin test.
- The Food Analyst's report indicated the presence of vanaspati in the Khoa, leading to the complaint against the appellants.
- The appellants argued that the Khoa was not for direct sale and was stored with other ingredients, claiming the presence of vanaspati could be due to cross-contamination.

Legal issues and arguments
- The appellants contended that the sample was improperly taken as the Khoa was not meant for sale and was in the process of being used for making sweets.
- They argued that the Food Safety Officer lacked authority to take samples from the processing area and that the Food Analyst's report did not specify the quantity of vanaspati.
- The respondent maintained that the sample was taken according to regulations and that the presence of vanaspati in Khoa violated the FSS Act.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the FSS Act mandates compliance with food safety standards at all stages of food production, including processing.
- It emphasized that even marginal deviations from prescribed standards are sufficient to warrant penalties under the FSS Act.
- The court found the appellants' arguments regarding the sampling method and potential contamination unconvincing, stating that they could have ensured proper cleaning of the utensils used during sampling.
- The court distinguished the cited cases from the appellants, asserting that they did not apply to the current facts.

Arun_Tiwari_vs_The_State_Of_Madhya_Pradesh_Thr_on_6_July_2018.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is Arun Tiwari vs The State of Madhya Pradesh, decided on 6 July 2018 by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh.
- The appeal was filed under Section 71(6) of the Food Safety & Standards Act, 2006, challenging a judgment from 26 August 2016 by the Sessions Judge, Morena, which confirmed an order from 31 October 2015 by the Adjudicating Officer.

Key facts
- On 20 October 2013, a tanker driven by appellant No.1, Arun Tiwari, and owned by appellant No.2, Pramod Sharma, was stopped by Food Safety Officer Ms. Rekha Soni.
- A sample of milk was taken, which was later tested and found to have milk fat at 0.2% (minimum required is 4.5%) and solids not fat at 7.18% (minimum required is 8.5%).
- The sample tested positive for formalin and was deemed sub-standard under Section 3(2x) of the Act.
- Both appellants were fined Rs. 5 lakh each by the Adjudicating Officer.

Legal issues and arguments
- Appellant No.1 argued that as a driver, he should not be penalized since he was not responsible for the milk's quality under Section 51 of the Act.
- Appellant No.2 contended that the prosecution failed to prove he was the owner of the goods and that no independent witness was examined during the sampling process.
- The appellants admitted that the sample was taken from their custody and did not appeal the Food Analyst's report.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the sampling process was not challenged and the report of the Food Analyst was conclusive, showing the sample was sub-standard.
- The court found that separate liability could not be imposed on both the driver and the owner since the driver was not aware of the adulteration and was merely operating the tanker.
- The court rejected the argument that the prosecution had the burden to prove ownership of the goods, stating that the appellants needed to demonstrate the source of the material.

Decision or judgment
- The appeal was allowed in part; the penalty imposed on appellant No.1, Arun Tiwari, was set aside.
- The penalty on appellant No.2, Pramod Sharma, was upheld, and the appeal was disposed of accordingly.",High Court of Madhya Pradesh,"['Arun Tiwari', 'Pramod Sharma']",['The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr'],['Vivek Agarwal'],06-07-2018,[],"['Madhya Pradesh', 'Morena']","['Section 3(2x) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 46(4) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 51 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']",[],"The appellants were penalized for sub-standard milk found during a routine check.

B_S_N_L_vs_Telecom_Regulatory_Auth_Of_India_Ors_on_6_December_2013.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) as the appellant against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and others as respondents. The judgment was delivered by a bench comprising Justices G.S. Singhvi, B.S. Chauhan, and Fakkir Mohamed Ibrahim Kalifulla on December 6, 2013.

Key facts
- The case arose from various appeals concerning the powers of TRAI to regulate interconnectivity and related charges among telecom service providers. The appeals were consolidated from multiple civil appeals filed by BSNL and other telecom operators.
- A significant order dated February 6, 2007, referred several substantial questions of law to a larger bench for determination, including the relationship between the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the TRAI Act, 1997.

Legal issues and arguments
- The primary legal issues included whether TRAI has the authority to fix terms and conditions of interconnectivity between service providers, especially regarding licenses issued before and after January 24, 2000.
- The arguments presented by BSNL and other appellants focused on the jurisdiction of the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) to challenge regulations framed by TRAI under Section 36 of the TRAI Act.
- The respondents contended that TDSAT does not have jurisdiction over regulations as they are subordinate legislation, while the appellants argued for the inclusion of such regulations under TDSAT's review powers.

Court's reasoning
- The court analyzed the powers conferred upon TRAI under the TRAI Act, particularly Sections 11 and 36, and the implications of the amendments made in 2000.
- It was determined that the power to make regulations under Section 36 is broad and not limited by the specific provisions of the Act. The court emphasized that regulations made under Section 36 are subordinate legislation and can be subject to judicial review.
- The court concluded that TDSAT does not have jurisdiction to entertain challenges to the regulations framed by TRAI under Section 36, as these regulations are not classified as 'directions', 'decisions', or 'orders' under Section 14(b) of the Act.

Decision or judgment
- The court held that TDSAT lacks jurisdiction to review the validity of regulations made under Section 36 of the TRAI Act. However, it clarified that aggrieved parties could challenge the validity of such regulations in the High Court.
- The judgment effectively reversed the contrary views taken by TDSAT and the Delhi High Court, establishing a clear delineation of powers between TRAI and TDSAT regarding regulatory matters.",Supreme Court of India,['Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited'],"['Telecom Regulatory Authority of India', 'Sistema Shyam TeleServices Limited', 'Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited', 'Cellular Operators Association of India', 'Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India']","['G.S.

Dharmendra_Kumar_Raja_vs_The_State_Of_Bihar_Through_The_Director_on_8_April_2016.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is titled Dharmendra Kumar @ Raja vs The State Of Bihar, decided on April 8, 2016, in the High Court of Judicature at Patna under Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 119 of 2016.
- The petitioner, Dharmendra Kumar, sought to quash the First Information Report (FIR) and charge sheet related to Case No. 344 of 2015, registered under Section 58 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

Key facts
- The FIR was lodged by the Food Safety Officer after a raid on Banarsi Paan Shop, owned by the petitioner, where Paan Masala and Zarda (chewing tobacco) were seized.
- The petitioner argued that the police had no jurisdiction to register the FIR or conduct the investigation under the Food Safety and Standards Act, as Section 58 only imposes penalties and does not provide for criminal prosecution.

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioner contended that Section 58 of the Act does not constitute an offence that can be prosecuted criminally, as it only allows for the imposition of penalties.
- The petitioner also claimed that the seizure of chewing tobacco was beyond the jurisdiction of the Food Safety Officer, as it is classified as a scheduled tobacco product.
- The petitioner argued that the actions taken by the police and the Food Safety Officer were without jurisdiction and thus the FIR and charge sheet should be quashed.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the Food Safety and Standards Act distinguishes between penalties and punishments, with Sections 50 to 58 dealing with penalties and Sections 59 to 64 dealing with punishments that may include imprisonment.
- The court referred to previous case law, including R.P. Kapoor v. State of Punjab and State of Haryana v. Bhajanlal, which established that FIRs can be quashed if they do not disclose an offence or if the allegations are inherently improbable.
- The court emphasized that the Act provides a specific mechanism for adjudication of offences and penalties, which does not involve police jurisdiction for the offences under Sections 50 to 58.

Decision or judgment
- The High Court quashed the FIR and charge sheet against the petitioner, concluding that the actions taken by the police and the Food Safety Officer were without jurisdiction and untenable in law.",High Court of Judicature at Patna,['Dharmendra Kumar @ Raja'],"['The State of Bihar through the Director General of Police, Bihar Patna', 'The Senior Superintendent of Police, District Patna, Bihar', 'The City Superintendent of Police ( Central ), District - Patna, Bihar', 'The Officer In Charge Gandhi Maidan, Police Station, District Patna, Bihar', 'The Investigation officer Cum Sub Inspector of Police, Gandhi Maidan Police Station, District - Patna, Bihar', 'Food Safety officer, Office of Commissioner of Food Safety, Patna']",['Honourable The Acting Chief Justice'],08-04-2016,[],"['Patna', 'Bihar']","['Section 58 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 173(2)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973', 'Indian Penal Code, 1860']","['R.P.

Diamond_Beverages_Private_Limited_vs_Food_Safety_Officer_on_17_October_2023.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is titled Diamond Beverages Private Limited vs Food Safety Officer, decided on 17 October 2023 by Justice Harish Tandon.

Key facts
- The proceedings began on 18 February 2017 when packaged drinking water was seized for alleged misbranding under Section 3(1)(zf) of the Food Safety and Standards Act.
- The adjudicating authority ruled out the misbranding allegations but issued an advisory order requiring the appellant to disclose the names of sodium salts on the label, citing a violation of Regulation 2.2.2.2 (c) of the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labeling) Regulations, 2011.

Legal issues and arguments
- The appellant contended that the adjudicating officer overstepped their jurisdiction by issuing an improvement order, which should only be within the powers of a designated officer as defined in the Act.
- Section 32 of the Act allows designated officers to issue improvement notices based on reasonable belief of non-compliance, while Section 68 pertains to adjudication with distinct eligibility criteria.
- The appellant argued that the powers of the adjudicating officer are akin to those of a Civil Court and should not include the authority to issue improvement orders.

Court's reasoning
- The court found that the adjudicating officer cannot usurp the powers of the designated officer, as the latter has specific functions and powers outlined in Section 36 of the Act.
- The court noted that the powers of the adjudicating officer are distinct and do not include the authority to issue improvement orders under Section 32.
- A prima facie case was established by the appellant, warranting the admission of the appeal and the issuance of an interim order.

Firestone_Tyre_And_Rubber_Company_Of_vs_Their_Workmen_Including_Clerical_on_24_November_1958.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is a reference by the Government of Bombay under Section 12(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, regarding a dispute between Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company of India (Private) Ltd. and its workmen, including clerical staff, concerning a demand for bonus for the year ending 31 October 1957.

Key facts
- The Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company was established in 1930 and has operated a factory in Sewree, Bombay, since 1939. The company is a subsidiary of a parent company in the United States, with a paid-up capital of Rs. 20,000.
- The employees demanded an unconditional bonus equivalent to three-fourths of their total earnings for the financial year ending 31 October 1957, including overtime and allowances.
- The company has been making significant profits, but the union claims that wages and salaries are inadequate and do not meet the living wage standard.
- The company previously awarded bonuses of six months' basic wages for the years 1954-55 and 1955-56, but for 1956-57, it paid only one-sixth of the basic earnings as an advance against bonus.

Legal issues and arguments
- The union argues that the two conditions for bonus justification set by the Supreme Court are met: wages fall short of the living wage standard, and the industry is making substantial profits.
- The company contends that the demand for a bonus equal to six months' wages is unreasonable and that it has already paid a fair bonus of two months' basic wages. It cites ongoing expansion costs and high taxation as reasons for limiting the bonus.
- The company also argues that it provides various employee benefits and that the wages paid are competitive within the industry.

Court's reasoning
- The court considered the historical context of bonuses awarded to the employees, the company's financial situation, and the living wage standards.
- It noted that while the company has made profits, the wages paid to workers, particularly in lower categories, still fall short of a living wage.
- The court emphasized the need to balance the interests of the workers with the economic implications of awarding a high bonus, which could lead to repercussions in other industries.
- The court referenced previous awards and decisions regarding bonus calculations, emphasizing that bonuses should supplement wages without creating disparities or industrial discontent.

Decision or judgment
- The court awarded a bonus equal to five-twelfths of the basic earnings (excluding overtime and dearness allowances) for the year ending 31 October 1957, less any bonus already paid.
- The company is directed to pay the awarded bonus within six weeks of the award becoming enforceable, subject to specific conditions regarding eligibility for casual workers and those dismissed for misconduct.","Industrial Tribunal, Bombay","[""Firestone Tyre Employees' Union, Bombay""]","['Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company of India (Private), Ltd., Bombay']",[],24-11-1958,[],"['Greater Bombay', 'Bombay']","['Section 12(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947']","['Industrial Disputes Act, 1947']","['Muir Mills, Ltd. v.

Court's reasoning

- The court examined the provisions of the FSS Act, particularly Sections 30, 38, 41, and 42, which outline the powers of Food Safety Officers and the procedures for prosecution.
- It was determined that the contraventions related to the prohibitory order issued by the Commissioner of Food Safety should be adjudicated under the FSS Act, specifically under Section 55, which deals with penalties for non-compliance with Food Safety Officer directions.
- The court found that the police actions under IPC sections were inappropriate as the violations did not constitute criminal offenses under the IPC, particularly since the products had not been analyzed for adulteration.
- The court noted that the definitions of adulteration and unsafe food under the FSS Act were not met, as there was no evidence of the products being harmful or adulterated based on a food analysis report.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all criminal writ petitions and applications, declaring the police actions against the petitioners under IPC sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 as illegal and quashed the complaints.
- The court clarified that the Food Safety Officers could still proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act.",High Court of Judicature at Bombay,"['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.

Girwardayal_vs_The_State_Of_Madhya_Pradesh_on_10_February_2023.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is titled Girwardayal vs The State of Madhya Pradesh, heard on February 10, 2023, by Justice Subodh Abhyankar in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh.
- The petitioner, Girwardayal, seeks to quash an FIR registered against him under Section 420 of the IPC.

Key facts
- The FIR was lodged at Crime No. 52/2021 at Police Station-Sendhwa City, District-Badwani.
- On December 3, 2020, the Food Safety Department inspected Girwardayal's shop, Sharma Namkeen, and collected samples of food products.
- The samples were analyzed, and the report dated January 30, 2021, indicated that the food products were within norms.

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioner argues that the charge under Section 420 IPC is unfounded as none of its ingredients are present; specifically, it is acknowledged that the food products were not sold but manufactured at his shop.
- The petitioner also references a prior order from January 12, 2023, by the Principal District Judge Badwani, which rejected a case against him regarding misbranding, granting him a clean chit.
- The respondent's counsel contends that the Food Safety Officer was incorrectly named in his personal capacity in the petition.
- The State's counsel opposes the quashing of the FIR, asserting that there is no basis for interference at this stage, although it is acknowledged that the petitioner was not selling the products.

Court's reasoning
- The court reviewed the submissions and the FIR, noting that the Food Safety Officer had initially found the food products to be substandard, but this was contradicted by the analyst's report.
- The court highlighted that there were no complaints from consumers regarding the food products sold by the petitioner, nor evidence that any products were sold that did not meet standards.
- The court concluded that the essential elements of Section 420 IPC were absent, and continuing the trial would constitute a misuse of legal process.

Itc_Limited_vs_State_Of_Madhya_Pradesh_on_27_November_2024.PDF,"Case overview
The case ITC Limited vs State of Madhya Pradesh was heard in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior, on November 27, 2024.

Key facts
- ITC Limited is engaged in manufacturing and marketing packaged food products, including biscuits under the brand name 'Sunfeast' since 2003.
- The biscuits comply with the standards set by the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulation, 2011.

- The notice regarding the sample was served only to the retailer, denying ITC Limited the right to appeal.
- The sanction to initiate proceedings against ITC was based solely on the Food Analyst's report.

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioner argued that the Food Analyst's report was invalid as it was not conducted by a NABL-accredited laboratory, which is a requirement under Section 43 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.
- The petitioner contended that the report did not indicate any adulteration or non-compliance with applicable standards and lacked reasoning for the misbranding claim.
- The petitioner claimed it was denied the right to effective representation and appeal, as it was not notified about the proceedings.

- The court found that the State Food Testing Laboratory, Bhopal, was not accredited by NABL, rendering the Food Analyst's report invalid.
- The court noted that the report was the basis for prosecution and could not be relied upon due to the lack of proper accreditation.
- The court emphasized that the procedures outlined in the Food Safety and Standards Rules, 2011, regarding the rights of the food business operator and the referral laboratory were not followed.

Johel_Ahemad_S_O_Jamil_Ahemad_And_Anr_vs_The_State_Of_Maharashtra_Anr_on_4_March_2016.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves multiple Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications filed by various petitioners against the State of Maharashtra regarding the legality of actions taken by Food Safety Officers and the police concerning the transportation and possession of prohibited food items, specifically Gutka and Pan Masala.

Key facts
- On May 14, 2015, a petitioner was found transporting large quantities of Gutka and Pan Masala in a truck. The Food Safety Officer seized the goods and lodged a police complaint alleging violations of a government notification prohibiting such items, leading to the registration of a police case.
- The petitioners were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act).

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioners argued that the police complaint and registration of crimes under the IPC were illegal, particularly under Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328, as the actions taken were not warranted by the circumstances.
- The respondents contended that the petitioners violated the prohibitory order issued under Section 30 of the FSS Act, which allowed for the prohibition of certain food items in the interest of public health.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the FSS Act empowers the Food Safety Commissioner to prohibit the manufacture and sale of certain food items if deemed necessary for public health. The petitioners were found in violation of this order.
- The court examined the definitions and provisions of the FSS Act, particularly regarding the powers of Food Safety Officers to seize prohibited items and the procedures for prosecution.
- It was determined that the contraventions committed by the petitioners were subject to adjudication under the FSS Act and not under the IPC, as the violations did not involve actions punishable by imprisonment.
- The court found that the items in question had not been subjected to food analysis, and thus could not be classified as adulterated or unsafe under the IPC provisions cited.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications, declaring the actions taken by the police against the petitioners under the IPC as illegal and quashing the complaints.
- The court clarified that the Food Safety Officers could still proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act.",High Court of Judicature at Bombay,"['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.

Mahboob_Amirsab_Tamboli_And_Anr_vs_The_State_Of_Maharashtra_on_4_March_2016.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves multiple Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications filed against the State of Maharashtra regarding violations of food safety regulations, specifically concerning the transportation and sale of Gutka and Pan Masala.

Key facts
- The lead case, Criminal Writ Petition No. 1027 of 2015, involves the petitioner Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao, who was found transporting large quantities of Gutka and Pan Masala on May 14, 2015. The Food Safety Officer seized the goods and lodged a police complaint alleging violations of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act, 2006) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
- The petitioners were charged under Sections 26 and 30 of the FSS Act, 2006, and Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 of the IPC.

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioners argued that the police complaint and registration of crime under the IPC were illegal, particularly contesting the applicability of Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328.
- They contended that the FSS Act, 2006 provides a specific framework for dealing with violations related to food safety, and that the actions taken by the police were not warranted under the circumstances.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the FSS Act, 2006 empowers the Food Safety Commissioner to prohibit the sale and distribution of certain food items in the interest of public health. The prohibition on Gutka and Pan Masala was in effect at the time of the incident.
- The court emphasized that violations of the prohibitory order should be addressed under the FSS Act, specifically under Section 55, which deals with penalties for non-compliance with the directions of Food Safety Officers.
- The court found that the provisions of the IPC cited by the police were not applicable, as the contraventions did not involve the sale of adulterated food or the administration of harmful substances as defined by the IPC.
- The court highlighted that the Gutka and Pan Masala in question had not been subjected to food analysis, and thus there was no evidence to support claims of adulteration or that they were harmful.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications, declaring the actions taken by the police under Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 of the IPC as illegal and quashing the complaints.
- The court clarified that the Food Safety Officers retain the authority to proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act, 2006.","High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad","['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.

Modi_Rubber_Ltd_vs_Guardian_International_Corp_on_28_March_2007.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is between Modi Rubber Ltd. (MRL) and Guardian International Corp. regarding a dispute over a Shareholders Agreement (SHA) and a proposed wholly owned subsidiary by Guardian.

Key facts
- MRL and Guardian entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on July 1, 1988, to collaborate on a joint venture for manufacturing float glass in India.
- The SHA was executed on January 23, 1990, detailing shareholding percentages and management structure for the joint venture, Gujarat Guardian Ltd. (GGL).
- The SHA included a non-compete clause (Clause 14) prohibiting either party from engaging in similar business activities during the agreement's term.
- MRL was declared a sick company by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in May 2006, leading Guardian to assert that the SHA was frustrated and terminated.

Legal issues and arguments
- MRL sought an injunction to prevent Guardian from establishing a wholly owned subsidiary for float glass manufacturing, arguing that it violated the non-compete clause.
- Guardian contended that MRL's financial instability justified its termination of the SHA and its plans for a new subsidiary.
- The court needed to determine if MRL could seek interim relief despite Guardian's claims of frustration of the SHA.

Court's reasoning
- The court found that the SHA remained valid as both parties held more than 15% of shares, and Guardian's unilateral termination was not justified under the agreement's terms.
- The court emphasized that the non-compete clause was binding and that Guardian's actions to set up a subsidiary would likely cause irreparable harm to MRL and GGL.
- The court noted that the financial health of GGL was strong, and the proposed subsidiary would directly compete with it, undermining MRL's interests.

Decision or judgment
- The court granted MRL's petition, restraining Guardian from participating in any similar business or setting up a subsidiary in violation of the SHA until the arbitration proceedings concluded.
- The court clarified that its ruling was based on a prima facie assessment and did not preclude further examination of the merits in arbitration.",High Court of Delhi,['Modi Rubber Ltd.'],['Guardian International Corp.'],['Gita Mittal'],28-03-2007,"['Gujarat Alkalies Chemicals Ltd.', 'Gujarat Mineral Development Corp.']","['Gujarat', 'Delhi']","['Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996', 'Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act', 'Section 14(1)(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963']","['Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996', 'Indian Contract Act', 'Specific Relief Act, 1963', 'Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985']","['Gujarat Bottling Co.

- The appeal was filed against an order dated 07.08.2019, where the Adjudicating Officer found the appellants guilty of violating provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act) and the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labeling) Regulations, 2011 (FSS (P&L) Regulations), imposing a penalty of Rs. 50,000.

- The case is titled Mr. Ashok Bhaves vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh, decided on 9 September 2019 by Justice Vivek Rusia in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh.
- The petitioners, Ashok Bhave and others, are directors of Parle Agro Pvt. Ltd. and are challenging the proceedings related to a food safety violation.

Key facts:
- On 8 September 2015, a Food Safety Officer collected a sample of ""Frooti"" mango drink from Hotel Vrindavan for analysis.
- The sample was sent to a Food Analyst, and the report dated 26 September 2015 indicated the product was sub-standard.
- The petitioners were informed of the report on 2 January 2016, after the product's shelf life had expired (best before 26 October 2015).
- The Food Safety Officer sought permission to prosecute the petitioners on 17 June 2016, which was granted, leading to a show-cause notice issued on 25 June 2016.

Legal issues and arguments:
- The petitioners argue that they were denied the right to appeal under section 46(4) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, because the report was received after the product's shelf life had expired.
- They contend that the entire proceedings should be quashed as they could not exercise their statutory right to appeal.
- The respondents argue that the petitioners did not appeal despite receiving the report and that prosecution is valid based on the Food Analyst's report.

Mr_Nikhil_Asrani_vs_Sh_S_P_Singh_on_16_October_2020.PDF,"Case overview
- The case is titled Mr. Nikhil Asrani vs. Sh. S.P. Singh, adjudicated on 16 October 2020 in the Court of Sh. Dinesh Kumar Sharma, Principal District & Sessions Judge, New Delhi.
- The appeal (FSAT No. 22/2019) was filed against an order dated 07.08.2019 by the Adjudicating Officer (A.O.) which found the appellants in violation of various regulations under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act) and the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011 (FSS (P&L) Regulations).

Key facts
- The appellants include Mr. Nikhil Asrani, M/s Suresh Kumar & Co. (Impex) Pvt. Ltd., and M/s Fusion Basket.
- The case arose from a sample of Skippy Peanut Butter taken on 18.05.2017 by Food Safety Officer Sh. S.P. Singh from M/s Farm Square, which was later found to be misbranded.
- The Food Analyst's report indicated violations of specific labeling regulations, leading to penalties imposed by the A.O.

Legal issues and arguments
- The appellants contested the A.O.'s findings, arguing that:
  1. Regulation 2.2.2.2(f)(i) does not apply as Skippy Peanut Butter is a single ingredient food.
  2. The complete address of the manufacturer was provided on the label.
  3. The labeling of the product's shelf life was compliant with regulations.
  4. The sample was not sent to a NABL accredited laboratory, questioning the validity of the analysis.
- The respondent argued that the violations were valid and that the laboratory's report was legally sound under Section 98 of the FSS Act.

Court's reasoning
- The court examined the definitions and requirements under the FSS Act and the relevant regulations, particularly focusing on the definition of a food laboratory and the necessity for NABL accreditation.
- It was determined that the laboratory used for analysis was not accredited, rendering the analysis and subsequent findings unreliable.
- The court found that the A.O. failed to provide adequate reasoning for the conclusions reached in the impugned order, which lacked a detailed examination of the appellants' arguments and cited judgments.

Decision or judgment
- The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order dated 07.08.2019 was set aside due to the lack of proper reasoning and the invalidity of the laboratory analysis.
- The case was directed to be sent back to the relevant authorities along with a copy of the judgment.","Court of Sh.

Mr_Sayyed_Ali_Sayyed_Hasan_vs_The_State_Of_Maharashtra_And_Another_on_4_March_2016.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves multiple criminal writ petitions and applications filed by various petitioners against the State of Maharashtra and its officials regarding the enforcement of food safety regulations.
- The judgment was delivered by Justices A.V. Nirgude and Indira K. Jain on March 4, 2016.

Key facts
- The lead case, Criminal Writ Petition No. 1027 of 2015, involved a petitioner found transporting large quantities of tobacco products (Gutka and Pan Masala) in violation of a government notification prohibiting such actions.
- The Food Safety Officer seized the goods and lodged a police complaint, leading to the registration of a crime and the arrest of the petitioner.
- The petitioners argued that the police complaint and registration of crime under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) were illegal, particularly under Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328.

Legal issues and arguments
- The primary legal issue was whether the actions taken by the police were justified under the IPC or if they should have been addressed under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act).
- The petitioners contended that the contraventions were subject to adjudication under the FSS Act and not criminal prosecution under the IPC.
- The respondents argued that the petitioners' actions constituted offenses under the IPC due to the nature of the products involved.

Court's reasoning
- The court examined the provisions of the FSS Act, particularly Sections 30, 38, 41, and 42, which outline the powers of Food Safety Officers and the procedures for prosecution.
- It was determined that the contraventions of the prohibitory order issued by the Commissioner of Food Safety were not punishable under the IPC but rather under Section 55 of the FSS Act, which allows for penalties without criminal prosecution.
- The court noted that the products in question had not been subjected to food analysis to establish that they were adulterated or unsafe, which is necessary for IPC offenses related to food safety.
- The court concluded that the actions of the police in filing complaints under the IPC were not warranted and that the appropriate course of action would have been to proceed under the FSS Act.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all the criminal writ petitions and applications, declaring the police actions under Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 of the IPC as illegal and quashing the complaints.
- The court clarified that the Food Safety Officers could still proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act.",High Court of Judicature at Bombay,"['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.

Mr_Sayyed_Hasan_Sayyed_Subhan_And_vs_The_State_Of_Maharashtra_And_Another_on_4_March_2016.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves multiple Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications filed against the State of Maharashtra regarding the legality of actions taken by Food Safety Officers and the police concerning the transportation and possession of prohibited food items, specifically Gutka and Pan Masala.

Key facts
- On May 14, 2015, the petitioners were found transporting large quantities of Gutka and Pan Masala in a truck. The Food Safety Officer seized the goods and lodged a police complaint alleging violations of a government notification prohibiting such items, leading to the registration of a police case and the arrest of the petitioners.
- The petitioners were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act).

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioners contended that the police complaint and registration of crimes under the IPC were illegal, arguing that the actions should be governed solely by the FSS Act.
- They asserted that the provisions of the IPC cited (Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328) were not applicable to their case, as the items in question had not been proven to be adulterated or harmful through proper analysis.

Court's reasoning
- The court examined the powers of Food Safety Officers under the FSS Act, which allows them to seize prohibited items and take samples for analysis. It noted that the FSS Act provides a comprehensive framework for food safety and does not permit the application of IPC provisions for violations that are specifically addressed under the FSS Act.
- The court highlighted that the contraventions of the prohibitory order issued by the Commissioner of Food Safety should be adjudicated under the FSS Act, specifically under Section 55, which deals with penalties for non-compliance with Food Safety Officer directives.
- The court found that the items in question had not been subjected to food analysis, and thus, there was no basis for claiming they were adulterated or harmful, which is necessary for applying IPC sections related to food adulteration or causing harm.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications, declaring the actions taken by the police against the petitioners under the cited IPC sections as illegal and quashing the complaints.
- It clarified that while the police actions were quashed, the Food Safety Officers retained the authority to proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act.","High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad","['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.

- The case involves multiple Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications filed against the State of Maharashtra regarding violations of food safety regulations, specifically concerning the transportation and sale of Gutka and Pan Masala. The judgment was delivered by Justices A.V. Nirgude and Indira K. Jain on March 4, 2016.

Key facts
- The petitioners were found transporting large quantities of Gutka and Pan Masala, which were prohibited under a government notification dated May 15, 2014. The Food Safety Officer seized the goods and lodged a police complaint against the petitioners for violations under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act, 2006) and various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
- The petitioners argued that the police complaint and registration of crime were illegal, particularly regarding the IPC sections invoked.

Legal issues and arguments
- The primary legal issue was whether the actions taken by the police against the petitioners under IPC sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 were valid, given that the FSS Act provides specific provisions for handling violations related to food safety.
- The petitioners contended that the contraventions should be adjudicated under the FSS Act rather than through criminal prosecution under the IPC.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the FSS Act, 2006, consolidates food safety laws and empowers the Food Safety Commissioner to prohibit certain food items in the interest of public health. The court emphasized that violations of the prohibitory orders should be addressed under the FSS Act, specifically under Section 55, which deals with penalties for non-compliance with Food Safety Officer directives.
- The court found that the police actions under the IPC were inappropriate as the violations did not constitute criminal offenses under the IPC sections cited. The court highlighted that the Gutka and Pan Masala had not been subjected to food analysis to establish them as adulterated or unsafe.
- The court concluded that the provisions of the IPC cited by the police were not applicable to the case, as the FSS Act provides a comprehensive framework for addressing food safety violations.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications, declaring the police actions against the petitioners under IPC sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 as illegal and quashing the complaints.

Ltd. challenging the refusal of the Senior Inspecting Officer of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to draw samples from an imported consignment of chocolates for testing, based on alleged non-compliance with labeling requirements under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and its associated regulations.

Key facts: 
- The petitioner imported 18,000 kilograms of dark compound chocolates from Singapore, presented under Bill of Entry No. 5660421 dated 5.1.2012.
- The chocolates were inspected, but the first respondent refused to draw samples due to missing labeling information on the product's packaging, which was instead provided on a sticker.
- The petitioner argued that similar imports had been cleared in the past under similar labeling practices.

Legal issues and arguments: 
- The petitioner contended that the refusal to take samples was arbitrary and illegal, asserting that the labeling requirements were met as per the definitions in the Act.
- The respondents maintained that the labeling did not comply with the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, which they argued required certain information to be printed directly on the packaging.
- The petitioner cited previous court decisions supporting the rectification of labeling deficiencies and the acceptance of stickers as valid labeling.

Court's reasoning: 
- The court noted that the definition of a 'label' under the Act includes any descriptive matter attached to the packaging, which could include stickers.
- It was determined that the refusal to take samples was not justified, as the necessary information could be provided via stickers affixed to the packaging.
- The court emphasized that the primary concern of the regulations is consumer awareness and safety, which could be achieved through proper testing of the samples.

Decision or judgment: 
- The court set aside the impugned letter from the first respondent and directed the respondents to arrange for the sampling of the imported goods within seven days.
- The samples were to be sent for testing, and the goods would only be released if found fit for human consumption, upon payment of the appropriate duty.

M_S_Hamdard_Wakf_Laboratories_vs_Commissioner_Of_Commercial_Taxes_on_2_July_2018.PDF,"Case overview:
- The case involves M/S Hamdard (Wakf) Laboratories as the applicant and the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes as the opposite party.
- The judgment was delivered on July 2, 2018, by Hon'ble Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad.
- Multiple sales/trade tax revisions were consolidated, with Sales/Trade Tax Revision No. 527 of 2015 treated as the leading case.

Key facts:
- The product in question is ""Rooh Afza,"" which the applicant claims should be classified as a fruit drink under Entry 103 of Part A of Schedule II of the U.P. VAT Act, 2008.
- The applicant argued that the product is a non-alcoholic beverage containing fruit juice, supported by previous Supreme Court rulings.
- The respondent classified ""Rooh Afza"" as an unclassified item under the residuary entry of Schedule V, subject to a higher tax rate of 12.5%.

Legal issues and arguments:
- The main legal questions addressed were:
  A. Whether the Tribunal was justified in classifying ""Rooh Afza"" under the residuary entry instead of Entry 103.
  B. Whether the Tribunal's finding that ""Rooh Afza"" is known as 'sharbat' was legally justified.
  C. Whether the Tribunal considered the 'essential character' test in its classification.
- The applicant's counsel argued that the product should be classified as a fruit drink based on its composition and previous legal precedents.
- The respondent's counsel maintained that the product is a sugar concentrate and does not meet the criteria for classification as a fruit drink.

Court's reasoning:
- The court emphasized the importance of the common parlance test in determining the classification of goods for tax purposes.
- It noted that the product is marketed and understood as ""sharbat"" and not as a fruit drink or juice.
- The court found that the product does not meet the definition of a fruit drink as it contains only 10% fruit juice, which is below the required threshold for classification as a fruit syrup.
- The court referenced previous judgments that established the principle that a specific entry prevails over a residuary entry when classifying goods.
- The court concluded that the product is an unclassified item falling under the residuary entry of Schedule V, thus subject to a tax rate of 12.5%.

Decision or judgment:
- The court dismissed all revisions filed by M/S Hamdard (Wakf) Laboratories, affirming the Tribunal's classification of ""Rooh Afza"" as an unclassified item liable to tax at 12.5%.",High Court of Judicature at Allahabad,"['M/S Hamdard (Wakf) Laboratories', ""M/S Hamdard (Wakf) Laboratories Thru' Auth.

M_S_Itc_Limited_vs_Nestle_India_Limited_on_10_June_2020.PDF,"Case overview: The case involves a legal dispute between M/s. ITC Limited (plaintiff) and Nestle India Limited (defendant) regarding the use of the trademark ""Magic Masala"" by ITC and the defendant's use of ""Magical Masala"" for their instant noodles. The plaintiff sought various reliefs under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, including a permanent injunction against the defendant's use of the mark, destruction of infringing materials, and damages.

Key facts: The plaintiff launched ""Sunfeast Yippee! noodles"" with the variant ""Magic Masala"" in 2010. The defendant introduced ""Maggi xtra -delicious Magical Masala"" in 2013. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's mark was deceptively similar to its own, leading to confusion among consumers. The plaintiff argued that ""Magic Masala"" had acquired distinctiveness and goodwill in the market.

Legal issues and arguments: The court framed eleven issues, including whether the plaintiff was entitled to protect its mark, whether the defendant's use was bona fide, and whether the expressions were merely flavor descriptors. The plaintiff contended that the defendant's use was intended to pass off its product as that of the plaintiff's, while the defendant argued that both terms were common descriptors in the food industry and not distinctive.

Court's reasoning: The court analyzed the distinctiveness of the terms ""Magic"" and ""Masala"" and concluded that both were common in the food industry and not capable of exclusive appropriation. The court found that the plaintiff had not established that ""Magic Masala"" had acquired distinctiveness as a trademark. It also noted that the defendant's use of ""Magical Masala"" was not intended to deceive consumers but was a legitimate adoption of a common term.

Decision or judgment: The court dismissed the suit, ruling that the plaintiff was not entitled to any of the reliefs sought.

M_S_Nandhi_Dall_Mill_vs_The_Food_Safety_Officer_on_1_November_2016.PDF,"Case overview: The case involves M/s. Nandhi Dall Mill, represented by its General Manager, Mr. B. Selvarathinam, as the petitioner against the Food Safety Officer and other respondents regarding a penalty imposed for food safety violations. 

Key facts: The petitioner is a manufacturer of Dhall and pulses, holding an Agmark Certificate, ISO Certification, and Import and Export Registration. A surprise raid on 28.08.2014 at a provision shop led to the seizure of a product (Appalam) from the petitioner, which was later found to contain Sodium Bi-Carbonate. An order was issued on 07.05.2015 imposing a penalty of Rs. 1,00,000 for manufacturing a sub-standard product. The petitioner contends that the seized product was expired and thus they should not be held liable. An appeal was filed on 22.06.2015, but the Appellate Authority was not functioning due to the absence of a Presiding Officer, delaying the appeal process. 

Legal issues and arguments: The petitioner argues that the imposition of the penalty is premature as their appeal is pending and has not been processed. The respondents, represented by the Special Government Pleader, assert that the original authority has the right to enforce the penalty unless stayed by the Appellate Authority. 

Court's reasoning: The court acknowledges the petitioner's grievance regarding the delay in the appeal process due to the non-functioning of the Appellate Tribunal. It recognizes the need for the petitioner to deposit the penalty amount but clarifies that this deposit will not be treated as a penalty and will be held in a separate account pending the appeal's outcome. 

Decision or judgment: The court directs the petitioner to deposit Rs. 1,00,000 with the second respondent within one week, without prejudice to the pending appeal.

- The case involves M/s. Parle Agro (P) Ltd. as the appellant against the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Trivandrum, and other related parties in multiple civil appeals concerning the classification and tax rate of the product 'Appy Fizz' under the Kerala Value Added Tax Act, 2003.

Key facts
- M/s. Parle Agro (P) Ltd. is a dealer of 'Appy Fizz', a fruit juice-based drink, which was classified under Entry 71 of the Kerala VAT Act until 2007, with a VAT rate of 12.5%.
- In 2015, the authorities proposed to classify 'Appy Fizz' as an 'aerated branded soft drink' under Section 6(1)(a) of the Act, imposing a 20% tax rate.
- The appellant filed a clarification application under Section 94 of the Act, asserting that 'Appy Fizz' should be classified as a fruit juice-based drink.
- The Kerala High Court upheld the authorities' classification, leading to appeals to the Supreme Court.

Legal issues and arguments
- The main legal issues include the correct classification of 'Appy Fizz' under the VAT Act, the applicability of common parlance versus technical definitions, and the relevance of previous court rulings.
- The appellant argued that 'Appy Fizz' is a fruit juice-based drink, supported by expert opinions and previous classifications, while the respondent contended it is an aerated drink based on legislative amendments.

Court's reasoning
- The Supreme Court examined the legislative history of the VAT Act, particularly the amendments made by S.R.O. No. 119 of 2008, which altered the classification of non-alcoholic beverages.
- The Court noted that the term 'aerated' has a scientific meaning and that the common parlance test applied by the High Court was not the only applicable standard.
- The Court emphasized the importance of technical and scientific evidence regarding the manufacturing process and the nature of 'Appy Fizz', which contains over 10% fruit juice and is thermally processed, not aerated in the traditional sense.
- The Court also referenced the Food Safety Authority's classification of 'Appy Fizz' as a fruit drink, which was relevant to the case.

Decision or judgment
- The Supreme Court allowed the civil appeals arising from SLP(C) Nos. 14697-98 of 2016, overturning the previous judgments and declaring that 'Appy Fizz' should be classified under Item No. 5 of Entry 71 with a tax rate of 12.5%.
- The appeal arising from SLP(C) No. 9467 of 2016 was dismissed, and the appeals from SLP(C) Nos. 24460-61 of 2016 were disposed of, directing that proceedings against the assessee be concluded in light of the Court's judgment.",Supreme Court of India,"['M/S.

Nandhi_Dall_Mill_vs_The_Food_Safety_Officer_on_19_April_2018.PDF,"Case overview: The case involves Nandhi Dall Mill, represented by its General Manager, Mr. B. Selvarathinam, appealing against an order from a learned Single Judge regarding a fine imposed by the Food Safety Officer for manufacturing a sub-standard product. 

Key facts: Following a surprise inspection, a sub-standard product was found, leading to its seizure and analysis. The appellant was fined Rs. 1,00,000 for this violation. The appellant filed an appeal with the Food Safety Appellate Tribunal, which was not processed due to the non-functioning of the tribunal. Consequently, the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court.

Legal issues and arguments: The appellant contended that the learned Single Judge's order to deposit the fine amount was unjust, especially since the appeal was filed in a timely manner. The appellant argued that the deposit should not be required while the appeal was pending.

Court's reasoning: The court noted that the learned Single Judge's directive to deposit the amount was not a penalty but a requirement to keep the amount in a separate account pending the appeal's resolution. The court emphasized that the appellate authority would decide on the return of the deposit based on its findings, and thus found no illegality in the Single Judge's order.

Decision or judgment: The writ appeal was dismissed, and the appellant was granted an additional four weeks to deposit the Rs. 1,00,000 as directed.

- The application was filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to quash an order dated 8 February 2021 by the Additional Sessions Judge, Gorakhpur, related to G.T. No. 148 of 2011 arising from Case Crime No. 406 of 2010.

Key facts
- The First Information Report (FIR) was lodged on 25 March 2010 against Nand Kishore Gupta and others under various sections including 419, 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
- The allegations included the preparation of spurious Khoya harmful to health, with a police raid leading to the arrest of several individuals and the recovery of various sweetmeat products.
- A chemical examination later revealed that the sample was not adulterated, leading to the removal of certain charges and the filing of a charge sheet under Sections 419, 420 IPC and Section 3(1) of the U.P. Gangster and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986.

Legal issues and arguments
- The applicant's counsel argued that there was no evidence linking Gupta to the alleged crimes, that the charges under the Gangster Act were improperly applied, and that the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 should govern the case instead of the repealed Food Adulteration Act.
- The applicant claimed that the trial court failed to consider the lack of evidence and improperly rejected the discharge application.
- The prosecution contended that sufficient evidence existed to support the charges, including witness statements and the nature of the recovered items.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the trial court had not adequately addressed the applicant's arguments or the evidence presented in the discharge application.
- It emphasized that the trial court must exercise its judicial mind to determine if a prima facie case exists for proceeding against the accused.
- The court highlighted that the Food Safety and Standards Act is a complete code for food-related offenses and that misbranding should not invoke IPC sections like 419 and 420.

- The petitioner, Nempal Singh, argued that the penalty was imposed without cogent reasons and was excessive given the maximum penalty under Section 51 is Rs. 5 lakhs.
- The petitioner filed a Regular Civil Appeal No. 128 of 2022 against the penalty, which resulted in an interim order dated 10.08.2022 that stayed 50% of the penalty without providing reasons.
- The petitioner requested a timely decision on the appeal and a stay on the recovery of the penalty.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the penalty order dated 29.11.2021 was ex parte and lacked any reasoning for the amount imposed.
- The interim order from the Appellate Court also failed to provide justification for the 50% stay on the penalty.
- The petitioner claimed innocence and alleged mala fide actions against him, stating that the allegations were false and frivolous.

Decision or judgment
- The High Court modified the interim order dated 10.08.2022 by staying the entire penalty of Rs. 3.00 lakhs.
- The court directed the concerned court to expedite the decision on Regular Civil Appeal No. 128 of 2022 within four months, after allowing reasonable hearing opportunities.

- Case Title: Nitin Kumar And Another vs Food Safety Appellate Tribunal And 2 Others
- Date of Judgment: 30 January 2023
- Court: High Court of Judicature at Allahabad
- Bench: Hon'ble Ajit Kumar, J.
- Case Number: MATTERS UNDER ARTICLE 227 No. - 918 of 2023

Key facts
- Petitioners: Nitin Kumar and another
- Respondents: Food Safety Appellate Tribunal and others
- The petitioners challenged an order from the appellate authority that temporarily stayed 50% of the penalty imposed under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 for selling a misbranded product.
- The product in question was 'Neoberry Jumbo Fun', with a total value of Rs. 1070, while the penalties imposed were significantly higher (Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 25,000 for petitioner no. 2, and Rs. 75,000 and Rs. 50,000 for petitioner no. 1).

Legal issues and arguments
- Petitioners argued that the driver (petitioner no. 1) should not be considered a distributor and thus should not be liable for the misbranding charge.
- They contended that the penalties were disproportionate to the value of the seized product and requested a stay on the penalties during the appeal.
- The Additional Chief Standing Counsel argued that the driver was jointly liable due to his role in the distribution process and that the penalties were appropriate given the nature of the violations.

Court's reasoning
- The court found merit in the argument that it should not interfere with the appellate authority's decision at this stage regarding petitioner no. 2 (the distributor).
- However, for petitioner no. 1 (the driver), the court recognized that he was acting under the direction of the distributor and should not be held liable in the same manner as the distributor.
- The court decided to stay the penalty imposed on the driver during the appeal process, while the penalty for the distributor would remain in effect as directed by the appellate court.

Decision or judgment
- The court partly allowed the petition, modifying the order regarding petitioner no. 1 (the driver) to stay the penalty during the appeal.
- Petitioner no. 1 was granted four weeks to make necessary deposits related to the penalty.
- The final outcome of the penalties would depend on the resolution of the appeal.",High Court of Judicature at Allahabad,"['Nitin Kumar', 'Another']","['Food Safety Appellate Tribunal', '2 Others']",['Ajit Kumar'],30-01-2023,[],[],"['Section 26 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 52 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 58 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']",[],"The petitioners challenged an order from the appellate authority that temporarily stayed 50% of the penalty imposed for selling a misbranded product.

- The case is a Writ Petition No. 13622 of 2023 filed by M/s. Oam Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd. against the State of Maharashtra and others. 
- The judgement was delivered by Justice Madhav J. Jamdar on 4th November 2023.

Key facts
- The Petitioners challenged an order dated 27th July 2023, which suspended their license for five days. 
- The Petitioners filed Appeal No. 44 of 2023 before the Appellate Tribunal (Commissioner of Food Safety), which initially stayed the suspension order. However, the Appeal was dismissed on 21st September 2023.

Legal issues and arguments
- The Petitioners contended that the Appellate Tribunal's dismissal was based on the absence of a provision for ""Extended shelf life"" and failed to consider the definition of ""best before date"" as per Section 2(1)(c) of the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2020. 
- The definition states that the ""best before date"" indicates the end of the period during which food remains marketable and retains specific qualities, and that food may still be safe to consume beyond this date, provided it has not become unsafe.

Court's reasoning
- The Court noted that the Appellate Tribunal did not consider the relevant definition of ""best before date"" in its decision. 
- Given this oversight, the Court found it necessary to remand the matter back to the Appellate Tribunal for reconsideration.

Decision or judgment
- The Court quashed the Appellate Tribunal's order dated 21st September 2023 and remanded the Appeal back to the Appellate Tribunal, instructing it to dispose of the Appeal by 31st December 2023.

Page_No_1_17_vs_Smti_Nemluni_on_2_June_2023.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves appeals under Section 130 of the Customs Act, 1962, filed by the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) and the Additional Commissioner of Customs against Smti. Nemluni and others regarding the confiscation of betel nuts suspected to be of foreign origin.

Key facts
- The appeals arise from a common factual background where seven trucks loaded with betel nuts were intercepted based on intelligence inputs. 
- The trucks were detained, and a subsequent search at a godown led to the recovery of 196 bags of betel nuts.
- The drivers and caretakers could not provide documentation for the legal importation of the betel nuts, leading to the belief that they were smuggled from Myanmar.
- Show cause notices were issued, and the Additional Commissioner ordered confiscation of the betel nuts, except for one truck found to conform to standards.
- The appellate authority upheld the confiscation, but the Appellate Tribunal later reversed this decision, leading to the current appeals.

Legal issues and arguments
- The substantial questions of law framed for determination included whether the CESTAT erred in its standard of proof under Section 123 of the Customs Act, whether it was correct to set aside the confiscation order despite the goods being unfit for human consumption, and whether the findings were perverse.
- The appellants argued that the CESTAT required proof beyond reasonable doubt, which they contended was incorrect, and that the seized goods were unfit for consumption, warranting destruction.
- The respondents argued that the burden of proof lay with the appellants, as betel nuts are not notified goods under Section 123, and that the CESTAT's findings were not perverse.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that under Section 123, the burden of proof shifts to the person from whom goods are seized only if the goods are notified under subsection 2 of Section 123. Since betel nuts are not notified goods, the initial burden remained with the revenue authority.
- The court found that the revenue authority failed to establish that the seized goods were of foreign origin, as there was no credible evidence or expert opinion supporting this claim.
- The court also highlighted that the goods were seized within Indian territory, and the mere fact of previous seizures in the region did not suffice to conclude that these specific goods were smuggled.
- Regarding the quality of the seized betel nuts, the court noted that they were initially found fit for human consumption but later deemed unfit, which was not a concern for the Customs authority in the context of confiscation.

Decision or judgment
- The appeals were dismissed, with the court finding no merit in the appellants' arguments.

- The case is Pradeep Kumar Gupta vs State Of U.P., decided on 12 May 2015 by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. The appeal is filed under Section 71(6) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, challenging an order from the District Judge, Agra, which reduced a penalty imposed by the Adjudicating Officer.

Key facts
- The appellant, Pradeep Kumar Gupta, is a petty food vendor. On 9 November 2012, a Food Safety Officer inspected his shop and found a sample of paneer to be sub-standard, containing less than the prescribed fat limit. Following this, a complaint was filed, leading to a penalty of Rs. 5 lacs imposed by the Adjudicating Officer on 19 February 2015. The appellant appealed to the Food Safety Appellate Tribunal, which required a 50% deposit of the penalty for the appeal to be admitted.

Legal issues and arguments
- The primary legal issue is whether the adjudication proceedings under Chapter X of the Food Safety and Standards Act are civil or criminal in nature. The appellant's counsel argued that the proceedings are criminal, while the respondent's counsel contended they are civil, citing various provisions of the Act and Supreme Court judgments.

Court's reasoning
- The court analyzed the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, particularly Sections 68, 70, and 71, which outline the powers of the Adjudicating Officer and the Food Safety Appellate Tribunal. It concluded that these bodies exercise civil court powers and that the proceedings are not criminal in nature. The court referenced Supreme Court rulings that distinguish between adjudication and criminal prosecution, emphasizing that penalties under the Act are civil obligations rather than criminal punishments.

Decision or judgment
- The court upheld the objection raised by the learned A.G.A. and ruled that the appeal against the Adjudicating Officer's decision should be treated as a ""Civil Miscellaneous Appeal"" rather than a ""Criminal Appeal."" Consequently, the appeal was de-registered as a criminal appeal and re-registered as an appeal from order.

P_K_Koul_vs_Estate_Officer_Anr_on_30_November_2010.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves multiple writ petitions filed by displaced persons from the Kashmir valley, primarily former Central Government employees, against the Estate Officer and others regarding their eviction from government accommodations in Delhi. The petitions highlight the plight of these individuals who were forced to flee their homes due to violence and ethnic cleansing in Jammu & Kashmir after December 1989.

Key facts
- The petitioners were allotted government accommodations in Delhi after being evacuated from Kashmir due to threats to their lives and properties. Many of them lost their homes and properties in Kashmir due to communal riots and terrorist activities.
- The petitioners include individuals like P.K. Koul, who lost all property in Kashmir and were left with no alternative shelter. Others, like Smt. Phoola Raina, are dependents of deceased government employees who also faced similar threats.
- The government had previously allowed other similarly situated individuals to retain their accommodations, but the petitioners' requests were denied.

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioners argue that their eviction under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 is unconstitutional as it violates their fundamental rights under Articles 19(1)(e) and 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantee the right to reside and the right to life, respectively.
- They contend that the state has a duty to protect their rights and provide shelter, especially given their status as internally displaced persons (IDPs).
- The respondents argue that the petitioners are unauthorized occupants since their allotments were cancelled upon retirement and that they have no right to continue occupying the premises.

Court's reasoning
- The court emphasized that the right to shelter is a fundamental right and that the state has a constitutional obligation to protect the lives and properties of its citizens.
- It noted that the petitioners were not in unauthorized occupation as their circumstances were unique, stemming from the state's failure to protect them from violence and their subsequent displacement.
- The court referred to various precedents where similar rights were upheld, highlighting the need for the state to provide adequate housing and rehabilitation for IDPs.
- The court criticized the respondents for failing to exercise discretion in favor of the petitioners and for not providing alternative accommodations despite their admitted inability to ensure the safety of the petitioners if they returned to Kashmir.

Decision or judgment
- The court quashed the eviction orders and the cancellation of the allotments, allowing the petitioners to retain their accommodations until the state provides suitable alternative housing.
- The respondents were directed to take steps to rehabilitate and resettle the petitioners adequately.

- The petitioners argued that the charges under IPC Sections 272 (adulteration of food), 273 (sale of noxious food), 188 (disobedience to order), and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) were not applicable as the goods were not analyzed for adulteration.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the FSS Act, 2006 provides specific provisions for enforcement and penalties related to food safety violations, and that violations of the prohibitory order should be adjudicated under the FSS Act rather than the IPC.
- The court emphasized that the Food Safety Officers have the authority to seize prohibited articles and that the actions taken should be in accordance with the FSS Act.
- The court found that the lack of food analysis reports meant that the allegations of adulteration and the applicability of IPC sections were unfounded.
- The court concluded that the actions taken by the police under the IPC were illegal and that the violations should be addressed under the FSS Act.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications, declaring the police actions against the petitioners under IPC Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 as illegal and quashed the complaints.
- The court clarified that the Food Safety Officers are still permitted to proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act, 2006.",High Court of Judicature at Bombay,"['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.

R_Chandramohan_vs_The_Food_Safety_Officer_on_1_October_2019.PDF,"Case overview: The case involves a writ petition filed by R. Chandramohan against the Food Safety Officer and the Adjudicating Authority regarding an order imposing penalties under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The petition was heard by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on October 1, 2019.

Key facts: R. Chandramohan manufactures and markets gingelly oil under the brand 'CM Gold Palmolein Oil'. On August 23, 2017, samples of the oil were taken by the Food Safety Officer, leading to proceedings under the Food Safety and Standards Act. An order dated November 12, 2018, imposed penalties of Rs. 10,000 each on the seller and shop owner, and Rs. 50,000 on the manufacturer (R. Chandramohan).

Legal issues and arguments: The petitioner challenged the impugned order on three grounds: 1) The Food Analyst did not send the report within the 14-day period mandated by Section 42(2) of the Act; 2) The complaint was based on the product being substandard, but the order incorrectly stated it was misbranded; 3) The order did not adequately explain the basis for the penalty amount imposed under Section 49 of the Act.

Court's reasoning: The court noted that while there is a provision for appeal under Section 70 of the Act, the Appellate Tribunal had not been constituted at the time of the petition, rendering the alternate remedy ineffective. The court found that the impugned order did not violate Section 49, as the reasons for the penalty were articulated. Regarding the misbranding issue, the court accepted the state's argument that it was a typographical error. However, the court agreed with the petitioner on the violation of Section 42(2) since the impugned order did not address the delay in sending the report, which is a mandatory requirement.

Sachin_S_O_Jawaharlal_Jain_vs_The_State_Of_Maharashtra_on_4_March_2016.PDF,"Case overview
- The case involves multiple Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications filed against the State of Maharashtra regarding the legality of actions taken by Food Safety Officers and the police against the petitioners for violations related to the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act, 2006).

Key facts
- On May 14, 2015, the petitioner was found transporting large quantities of tobacco pouches (Gutka) in a truck, which led to the seizure of the goods by a Food Safety Officer.
- The officer lodged a police complaint alleging violations of a government notification prohibiting certain acts related to Gutka and Pan Masala, resulting in the registration of a crime and the arrest of the petitioner.
- The petitioners claimed that the police complaint and registration of crime under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) were illegal, particularly under Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328.

Legal issues and arguments
- The petitioners argued that the actions taken by the police were not warranted under the IPC as the violations were subject to adjudication under the FSS Act, 2006.
- The court examined whether the Food Safety Officers had the authority to lodge complaints with the police and whether the actions constituted offences under the IPC.

Court's reasoning
- The court noted that the FSS Act, 2006 empowers the Food Safety Commissioner to prohibit the sale and distribution of certain food items in the interest of public health.
- The court highlighted that the FSS Act provides specific procedures for enforcement and adjudication of violations, distinguishing between offences punishable with imprisonment and those subject to fines.
- It was determined that the contraventions committed by the petitioners were not serious enough to warrant criminal prosecution under the IPC, as they fell under the purview of administrative penalties under the FSS Act.
- The court found that the items in question (Gutka and Pan Masala) had not been subjected to food analysis to establish that they were adulterated or unsafe, which is necessary to invoke IPC provisions.

Decision or judgment
- The court allowed all Criminal Writ Petitions and Applications, declaring the police actions against the petitioners under Sections 272, 273, 188, and 328 of the IPC as illegal and quashed the complaints.
- The court clarified that the Food Safety Officers could still proceed against the petitioners under the provisions of the FSS Act, 2006.",High Court of Judicature at Bombay,"['Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao', 'Chand Sahba Patel', 'Shankar Kanhaiyalal Lalwani', 'Sk.
