The charges against them included various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) such as Section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), Section 272 (selling noxious food), Section 273 (selling food that is unwholesome), and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), as well as several sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The applicants' counsel argued that the only non-bailable charge was under Section 328 of the IPC, and referenced a Supreme Court decision (Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs. State of Kerala) and a prior order from the Aurangabad Bench, which suggested that Section 328 may not apply if there was no intent to administer an intoxicant. The counsel also noted a conflicting view from a Mumbai bench that was under challenge in the Supreme Court, which had granted interim protection to the petitioner in that case.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) requested time to review the cited judgments before making further submissions. The court noted the conflicting views on the applicability of Section 328 and decided to grant anticipatory bail to the applicants under certain conditions. 

The court ordered that in the event of their arrest, both applicants would be released on bail upon executing a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 each, with one or two solvent sureties of the same amount.

1,Amluya_Anand_vs_State_on_8_March_2022.PDF,"**Case Summary: Amluya Anand vs State (8 March 2022)**  
**Court:** High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur  
**Bench:** Justice Sandeep Mehta  
**Petitioner:** Amluya Anand  
**Respondent:** State, through Vinod Sharma, Food Safety Officer  
**Case Number:** S.B. Criminal Misc(Pet.) No. 545/2020  
**Date of Pronouncement:** 08 March 2022  
**Background:**  
The petitioner, Amluya Anand, sought to quash the orders dated 07 April 2015 and 24 January 2020, which involved the taking of cognizance against him by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM), Merta, and the dismissal of his application to drop the proceedings under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act). The case stemmed from an incident on 24 October 2011, when a Food Safety Officer collected samples of mixed milk from a chilling center associated with Amul Dairy, where Anand was present as a representative. The samples were later reported as substandard and unsafe.  
**Key Events:**  
1. **Sampling and Reports:**  
   - On 24 October 2011, samples were taken from the Swastik Milk Chilling Centre.  
   - The initial report from the Food Analyst on 03 November 2011 indicated the milk was substandard.  
   - A request for re-examination was made, and a subsequent report from the Referral Food Laboratory on 10 September 2012 confirmed the milk was unsafe.  
2. **Prosecution Sanction:**  
   - The Joint Director of Medical and Health Services granted sanction for prosecution on 11 April 2014.  
   - The complaint was filed in the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court on 12 September 2014 but was returned due to lack of jurisdiction.  
   - The complaint was re-filed in the ACJM court on 07 April 2015, where cognizance was taken against Anand and others.  
3. **Legal Proceedings:**  
   - Anand filed for re-examination of the sample, which was denied by the Food Safety Officer.  
   - Anand's application to drop the proceedings was dismissed on 24 January 2020, leading to the current petition.  
**Arguments:**  
- **Petitioner's Argument:**  
   - Anand's counsel argued that the complaint was filed beyond the one-year limitation set by Section 77 of the FSS Act, which states that no cognizance can be taken after one year from the date of the offence unless extended by the Commissioner of Food Safety.  
   - The initial complaint was filed 2 years, 9 months, and 19 days after the sampling, and the re-filing was over 3 years after the sampling, with no extension granted.  
   - Cited previous judgments to support the argument that the proceedings should be quashed due to being time-barred.  
- **Respondent's Argument:**  
   - The Public Prosecutor contended that the prosecution was valid as the Joint Director had granted sanction, and the ACJM acted correctly in taking cognizance.  
   - Argued that the application for dropping proceedings was not maintainable as the Magistrate could not review its own order.  
**Judgment:**  
- The court found that the complaint was indeed filed beyond the statutory period of one year as mandated by Section 77 of the FSS Act.  
- The court noted that there was no evidence of an extension being granted by the Commissioner of Food Safety.  
- Consequently, the court quashed the proceedings of the criminal case No. 145/2015 against Amluya Anand, ruling that the trial court could not have taken cognizance due to the complaint being time-barred.  
- The miscellaneous petition was allowed, and the stay application was disposed of.",HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN AT JODHPUR,['Amluya Anand'],"['State, Through Vinod Sharma, Food Safety Officer']",['Sandeep Mehta'],08-03-2022,"['Amul Dairy', 'Food Safety Officer', 'Chief Medical And Health Office, Nagaur', 'Referral Food Laboratory, Ghaziabad', 'Joint Director, Medical and Health Services Zone, Ajmer']","['Mujjafarpur', 'Gurgaon', 'Nagaur', 'Devgarh Road, Thanwla District Nagaur', 'Jodhpur']","['Section 468 of Cr.P.C.', 'Section 77 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 26(2)(i) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Sri.V.V.S.S.R.

The applicant's counsel argued that the only non-bailable charge was under Section 328 of the IPC, which pertains to administering intoxicants with the intent to commit an offense. The counsel referenced a Supreme Court decision in Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs. State of Kerala, asserting that Section 328 may not apply as there was no evidence of an attempt to administer any intoxicant by the applicant.

4,Asha_Singh_vs_The_State_Of_Bihar_on_24_March_2022.PDF,"In the case of Asha Singh vs The State of Bihar, the petitioner, Asha Singh, sought anticipatory bail in connection with a C.B.I. investigation regarding serious allegations of abuse and neglect at a short-stay home for women and girls with mental disabilities, operated by an organization called ""SAKHI"". The case arose from a report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), which highlighted incidents of physical violence against the residents, inadequate living conditions, and the presence of sexual exploitation facilitated by staff members, including the petitioner.

The allegations included that the petitioner and another officer allowed outsiders into the home who sexually abused the inmates, and that the inmates were subjected to violence if they protested. The report indicated that the women were not provided with basic necessities such as clothing, food, and sanitary products. The C.B.I. investigation revealed further breaches of laws aimed at protecting women from violence and exploitation.

During the hearing, the petitioner's counsel argued that the accusations were exaggerated and that the statements from the inmates were unreliable. They pointed out that one inmate's prior actions, which included running away from the home, were indicative of her credibility issues. However, the court found that the evidence presented by the C.B.I. substantiated the claims of abuse and neglect.

Justice Ashutosh Kumar, presiding over the case, concluded that the serious nature of the allegations, particularly given the vulnerable status of the inmates, warranted a denial of bail. The court emphasized that the conditions in the home were unacceptable and that the reported violence against the inmates could not be justified.

Bhadang, addressed an anticipatory bail application filed by the applicant, Avinash Balkrishna Bhamre, on March 8, 2022. The applicant was apprehending arrest in connection with Crime No. 140/2021, which was registered at Police Station Pimpalgaon Baswant, Tal. Niphad, District Nashik.

6,Ayesha_Hajeera_Almas_vs_Chief_Secretary_on_15_March_2022.PDF,"On March 15, 2022, the High Court of Karnataka delivered a significant judgment in the case of Ayesha Hajeera Almas vs. Chief Secretary, addressing the contentious issue of wearing hijab in educational institutions. The case involved multiple writ petitions filed by several Muslim female students challenging a government order that mandated adherence to a specific dress code in schools, which they argued infringed upon their fundamental rights to practice their religion and express their identity.

### Key Parties Involved:
- **Petitioners:** Ayesha Hajeera Almas and other students, represented by various advocates including Prof. Ravivarma Kumar and Sanjay Hegde.
- **Respondents:** Chief Secretary of Karnataka, various educational institutions, and their officials, represented by the Advocate General Prabhuling K. Navadgi and others.

### Background:
The petitioners contended that wearing the hijab is an essential religious practice in Islam, protected under Article 25 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion. They argued that the government order issued on February 5, 2022, which enforced a dress code that excluded hijab, was unconstitutional and violated their rights to freedom of expression and personal autonomy.

### Court's Findings:
1. **Essential Religious Practice:** The court examined whether wearing hijab constitutes an essential religious practice in Islam. It concluded that the petitioners failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that hijab is a mandatory religious requirement. The court referenced previous judgments and legal principles that define essential religious practices, emphasizing that such practices must be fundamental to the religion itself.

2. **Government's Authority:** The court upheld the government's authority to prescribe a dress code in educational institutions, citing the Karnataka Education Act of 1983 and related rules. It found that the government order was a legitimate exercise of power aimed at maintaining discipline and promoting a secular educational environment.

3. **Public Order and Discipline:** The court noted that schools are 'qualified public places' where certain restrictions on individual expression can be justified to maintain order and discipline. It emphasized that the dress code was intended to foster equality among students and prevent any form of sectarianism.

4. **Reasonable Accommodation:** The petitioners' request to allow hijab as part of the uniform was rejected on the grounds that it would undermine the uniformity intended by the dress code. The court stated that allowing different forms of attire would create divisions among students, contrary to the principles of equality and integration.

5. **International Conventions:** The court acknowledged various international conventions aimed at promoting women's rights but concluded that the dress code's enforcement did not violate these principles, as it aimed to create a safe and inclusive educational environment.

### Final Decision:
The court dismissed all writ petitions, ruling that the prescription of a school uniform, which excludes hijab, is a reasonable restriction that does not violate the petitioners' fundamental rights. The court also stated that the government order was valid and necessary for maintaining discipline in educational institutions. Consequently, all pending applications related to the case were also dismissed, with costs made easy.

### Conclusion:
This judgment underscores the balance between individual rights and institutional discipline within the context of secular education in India. It highlights the court's role in interpreting constitutional rights in light of societal norms and the need for maintaining public order in educational settings.",High Court of Karnataka,"['Ayesha Hajeera Almas', 'Smt Resham', 'Miss Aishat Shifa', 'Miss Thairin Begam', 'Miss Shaheena', 'Miss Shifa Minaz', 'Dr Vinod G Kulkarni', 'Ms Asleena Haniya', 'Ms Zunaira Amber', 'Ghanshyam Upadhyay']","['Chief Secretary', 'State of Karnataka', 'Government PU College for Girls', 'District Commissioner Udupi District', 'The Director Karnataka Pre-University Board', 'Rudre Gowda', 'Gangadhar Sharma', 'Dr Yadav', 'Prakash Shetty', 'Dayananda D', 'Rudrappa', 'Shalini Nayak', 'Chaya Shetty', 'Dr Usha Naveen Chandra', 'Raghupathi Bhat', 'Yashpal Anand Surana']","['Ritu Raj Awasthi', 'Krishna S.

**Judgment Author:** Justice Vibha Kankanwadi  
**Key Parties:**  
- **Applicant:** Baswaraj Vishwanath Agre  
- **Respondent:** The State of Maharashtra  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around an anticipatory bail application filed by Baswaraj Vishwanath Agre in response to a First Information Report (FIR) lodged by a Food Safety Officer on 18th August 2021. The FIR was based on a report from Aurad Shahajani Police Station, which indicated that banned articles were seized from the applicant's possession on 15th August 2021. The applicant sought bail to avoid arrest related to the charges against him.  

**Arguments Presented:**  
1. **Applicant's Counsel:** The applicant's advocate argued for the grant of anticipatory bail, questioning why the police did not arrest the applicant at the time of the seizure if they had sufficient evidence against him.  
2. **State's Counsel:** The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) opposed the bail application, citing the serious nature of the offences under which the FIR was registered.  

**Court's Observations:**  
- The court noted the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the banned articles and the lack of immediate arrest by the police.  
- The court expressed the need for an explanation from the Investigating Officer, P.I. S.A. Kamat, regarding the decision not to arrest the applicant at the time of the seizure.  

**Court's Decision:**  
- The court granted interim protection to the applicant, allowing him to avoid arrest until further clarification was provided by the Investigating Officer.  
- The court issued a notice to the respondent (State) with a returnable date of 17th March 2022.  
- In the event of the applicant's arrest in connection with Crime No.154 of 2021, he was to be released on a Personal Recognizance (P.R.) Bond of Rs. 30,000 with two sureties of Rs. 15,000 each.  
- The applicant was ordered to report to Aurad Shahajani Police Station every Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. and to cooperate with the investigation.  
- The applicant was also instructed not to tamper with any evidence related to the prosecution.  
- The Investigating Officer was directed to file an affidavit explaining the lack of arrest and to provide documentation regarding the seizure of the articles by 16th March 2022.  

**Conclusion:**  
The court's decision reflects a balance between the applicant's rights and the need for a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the case, particularly regarding the actions of law enforcement at the time of the seizure.","High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad",['Baswaraj Vishwanath Agre'],['The State of Maharashtra'],['Vibha Kankanwadi'],03-03-2022,[],"['Maharashtra', 'Latur']","['Section 328 of IPC', 'Section 272 of IPC', 'Section 273 of IPC', 'Section 188 of IPC', 'Section 59(2)(i) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 59(2)(ii) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 59(2)(iv) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 30(2)(a) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Indian Penal Code', 'Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']",[],"The applicant, Baswaraj Vishwanath Agre, was involved in a case where banned articles were seized from his possession by the police.

The charges against him included violations of various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, as well as the Maharashtra Liquor Prohibition Act. Specifically, the prosecution alleged that a raid at the applicant's shop resulted in the seizure of banned tobacco and pan masala products valued at Rs. 9,763.

The applicant's counsel argued that the only non-bailable charge was under Section 328 of the IPC, which pertains to administering intoxicants with the intent to commit an offense. The counsel referenced a Supreme Court decision (Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs. State of Kerala) and a prior order from the Aurangabad Bench, which suggested that Section 328 may not apply in similar circumstances. The counsel also noted a conflicting view from a Mumbai bench that was under challenge in the Supreme Court, where interim protection had been granted to the petitioner.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) requested time to review the cited judgments before making further submissions. The court noted that the Aurangabad Bench's interpretation of Section 328 might not apply in this case, while the conflicting Mumbai bench's decision was still pending before the Supreme Court.

Ultimately, the court granted anticipatory bail to the applicant, stipulating that in the event of arrest, he would be released on a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties of the same amount. The applicant was ordered to report to the Investigating Officer on specified dates and to cooperate with the investigation, ensuring he would not tamper with evidence or witnesses.

No. 430 of 2008) concerning alleged violations of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. The case originated from a complaint filed by the Food Inspector after three bottles of mineral water were taken from a shop run by the first accused. The analysis of the water revealed that it did not meet the prescribed standards, leading to the initiation of criminal proceedings against Mathew and five others.

Initially, all accused except Mathew were acquitted in a judgment dated October 31, 2008. The case against Mathew was subsequently split and refiled, eventually becoming a long-pending case. Mathew sought to quash the proceedings against him, arguing that since all co-accused were acquitted, he should also be exonerated.

The court, presided over by Justice K. Haripal, noted that the evidence indicated that the bottles of mineral water were not sealed at the time of seizure, which was a critical procedural requirement under the Act. The learned Magistrate had emphasized this point in the acquittal of the co-accused. Furthermore, a certificate from the Central Food Laboratory indicated that a sample from the same batch conformed to the required standards, further supporting the argument for Mathew's exoneration.

The court concluded that since the previous judgment had become final and the procedural lapses were significant, there was little chance of a successful prosecution against Mathew. Therefore, the proceedings against him were quashed, and he was exonerated.

In the case CRLP/1377/2022, presided over by Hon'ble Justice D. Ramesh on March 9, 2022, the petitioner sought to quash the proceedings of F.I.R. No. 67 of 2022, which was registered at the Palacole Town Police Station in West Godavari District. The charges against the petitioner included violations under Sections 273 and 336 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 34(a) of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968, specifically concerning the handling of tobacco products.  
  
The petitioner’s counsel argued that the case was similar to previous cases where the court had quashed several F.I.R.s based on identical facts, specifically referencing a common order from Criminal Petition Nos. 5421 of 2019 and others. The counsel further cited a ruling from W.P. No. 3731 of 2018, where it was determined that police lacked jurisdiction to investigate offenses under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and that the transport or storage of tobacco products did not constitute an offense under Sections 270 to 273 of the IPC.  
  
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor acknowledged that the current case was indeed covered by the earlier court orders and agreed to the quashing of the F.I.R.  
  
In light of these arguments and the precedents set by previous rulings, the court allowed the petition, quashing F.I.R. No. 67 of 2022, and ordered the return of the seized tobacco products to the petitioner. Any pending miscellaneous petitions related to this Criminal Petition were also closed.

The petitions were filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, concerning FIRs registered for serious offenses including attempted murder (Section 307 IPC), assault (Section 353 IPC), cheating (Section 420 IPC), and violations of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), as well as the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act). 

The court noted that the offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), COTP Act, and FSS Act had been previously addressed in earlier rulings (Criminal Petition No. 5421 of 2019 and Criminal Petition No. 2966 of 2021), where similar FIRs were quashed based on identical facts. Consequently, the court ruled that the petitioners, who were similarly situated, were entitled to have their FIRs quashed for these specific offenses.

However, the court distinguished the offenses under the A.P. Excise Act and the NDPS Act, stating that these were not covered by the previous common orders. Therefore, the FIRs related to these offenses could not be quashed, and the investigation into these matters was allowed to continue.

**Court:** Sh. Akash Jain, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate-01, New Delhi District, Patiala House Courts  
**Date of Judgment:** 03 February 2022  
**Complainant:** Food Safety Officer, Department of Food Safety, Govt of NCT of Delhi  
**Accused:** Tulsi Ram Aggarwal, Proprietor of M/s Aggarwal Sweets & Restaurants  
**Date of Offence:** 15 March 2019  

**Background:**  
The case arose from a complaint filed under Section 26/59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act). On 15 March 2019, the Food Safety Officer (FSO), Chittra Bamola, purchased a sample of ""Laddu"" from the accused's establishment for analysis. The sample was taken from an open tray without any label declaration. The FSO followed proper procedures for sample collection, including mixing and sealing the samples.  

**Findings:**  
The sample was analyzed by a food analyst, who reported that the total dye content of synthetic color in the ""Laddu"" exceeded the permissible limit of 100 ppm, rendering it unsafe for human consumption. The accused was given an opportunity to appeal the findings, and a second analysis by a Referral Food Laboratory confirmed the initial findings, indicating even higher levels of artificial coloring.  

**Legal Proceedings:**  
The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution presented two witnesses, including the FSO and the Designated Officer, who corroborated the sample collection process. The accused's defense argued that the sample was not representative due to discrepancies between the two reports and that the collection utensils were not clean.  

**Court's Analysis:**  
The court found that the sample collection was conducted according to the FSS Act regulations and that the defense failed to provide credible evidence to support their claims regarding the cleanliness of the utensils. The court also referenced a Supreme Court ruling which established that the report from the Referral Food Laboratory supersedes the public analyst's report once an appeal is made.  

**Conclusion:**  
The court concluded that the evidence clearly demonstrated that the ""Laddu"" contained unsafe levels of artificial coloring, violating the FSS Act. Consequently, Tulsi Ram Aggarwal was convicted for selling unsafe food under the relevant provisions of the FSS Act.

The court scheduled a separate hearing for sentencing.","Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate-01, New Delhi District, Patiala House Courts","['Food Safety Officer, Department of Food Safety, Govt of NCT of Delhi']","['Tulsi Ram Aggarwal', 'M/s Aggarwal Sweets & Restaurants (Kanhiya Lal Gulkandi Ram)']",['Sh.

**Background:**  
Dabur India Ltd, a public limited company known for its packaged fruit juice under the trademark 'REAL', filed a suit against Shiv G Shetti and others for defamation and disparagement. The plaintiff claimed that a video posted by Defendant No. 1 on Facebook contained false and misleading information about its fruit juice products, which could harm its reputation and business.

**Key Arguments:**

- The court found that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case for an injunction, as the video was deemed false, misleading, and unscientific.  
- The balance of convenience favored the plaintiff, as the continued circulation of the video could cause irreparable harm to its reputation.  

**Decision:**  
- The court decreed in favor of Dabur India Ltd, ordering Defendant No. 1 to cease the circulation of the defamatory video and any similar content.  
- The defendants were directed to remove or block access to the URLs containing the impugned video.

The FIR, lodged by police constable Vishwas Mane, detailed an incident on October 22, 2021, where the police received a tip-off about the applicant carrying contraband items, specifically scented tobacco and gutka.

The applicant's counsel argued that she was allowed to leave the scene without arrest, suggesting that custodial interrogation was unnecessary and that there were undisclosed reasons for her being targeted. However, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) opposed the bail application, stating that the applicant had not cooperated with the investigation and had not provided information regarding the source of the contraband.

The court, presided over by Justice Sarang V. Kotwal, considered the arguments from both sides. The judge noted that the applicant was found in possession of a significant quantity of prohibited articles and had not cooperated with the investigation. The court concluded that custodial interrogation was necessary to ascertain the source of the contraband and the intended market for these items.

The case arose from a writ petition (W.P.(C.) No.5440/2020) filed by the Delhi Golf Club Employees Union, which sought multiple directions against the Union of India and various labor authorities regarding the deployment of contract labor at the Delhi Golf Club's Food and Beverages Department.

The appellant, represented by Senior Advocate Mr. Inderbir Singh Alag, argued that the learned Single Judge had failed to adequately address the submissions made in the writ petition. The Union of India and the Delhi Golf Club, represented by their respective advocates, contested the claims, asserting that the Conciliation Officer's file noting dated August 7, 2020, which indicated that the retrenchment of 66 workers was conducted without proper compliance with Section 25N(7) of the Industrial Disputes Act, was not an official order and that the Conciliation Officer lacked the authority to issue such an order.

The appellant sought various writs, including a prohibition on the deployment of contract labor, action against labor commissioners for statutory violations, and the revocation of the Principal Employer Registration Certificate for the Delhi Golf Club. They also requested the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to ensure compliance with food safety regulations.

The court noted that the learned Single Judge had not considered the argument regarding the nature of the Conciliation Officer's noting and whether it constituted an order. Consequently, the High Court allowed the appellant to file a review or clarification application with the learned Single Judge regarding this issue, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.

- **Respondents:** The State of Maharashtra and others, including the Director General of Police, Senior Police Inspector, Commissioner of Police Kamrup, and Officer in Charge of Chandmari Police Station.  

**Background:**  
The case arose from a writ appeal against an order dated 22 March 2022, which was issued in response to actions taken by the Maharashtra Police under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The appellant, Dharampal Satyapal Ltd, operates a manufacturing unit in Guwahati, Assam, producing 'Pan Masala'. The Maharashtra government had prohibited the manufacture, storage, distribution, or sale of 'Pan Masala' within its jurisdiction.  

On 6 December 2021, an FIR was lodged in Solapur, Maharashtra, regarding the seizure of a consignment of prohibited food items, including 'Rajanigandha Pan Masala', which was traced back to the appellant's factory in Assam. Following this, the Maharashtra Police conducted a search and seizure operation at the appellant's factory on 9 March 2022, sealing the premises and machinery.  

**Legal Arguments:**  
The appellant contended that the seizure was unlawful as there was no prohibition on 'Pan Masala' in Assam, and the police had failed to comply with the mandatory reporting requirements under Section 102(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The learned Single Judge had allowed limited access to the factory but maintained the seal on the machinery.  

**Judgment:**  
The Gauhati High Court found that the actions taken by the Maharashtra authorities were prima facie beyond their jurisdiction since the manufacture and sale of 'Pan Masala' were not prohibited in Assam. The court noted that there was no evidence that the appellant had sold 'Pan Masala' in Maharashtra.  

The court ruled that the factory should be unlocked, and the seals removed, allowing the appellant to regain possession of the premises and machinery, subject to a bank guarantee of one crore rupees. The court also mandated that the concerned Deputy Commissioner and police officer oversee the unlocking process, with a report to be submitted to the local magistrate.  

Additionally, the court directed the appellant to implead the Central Food Safety Officer and the Commissioner of Food Safety of Maharashtra as additional respondents.  

**Final Decision:**  
The court ordered the removal of the seals on the factory and allowed the appellant to take possession of its property after providing a bank guarantee. The case was scheduled for further hearing on 1 April 2022.",Gauhati High Court,['Dharampal Satyapal Ltd.'],"['The State of Maharashtra', 'Sanjay T Salunkhe', 'The Commissioner of Police Kamrup (M)', 'The Officer in Charge Chandmari Police Station']","['Chief Justice', 'Soumitra Saikia']",30-03-2022,"['Dharampal Satyapal Ltd.', 'Food Safety Officer, Solapur', 'Commissioner of Food Safety, Maharashtra']","['Maharashtra', 'Guwahati', 'Assam']","['Section 30(2)(a) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 26(2)(iv) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 102 of CrPC']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Indian Penal Code', 'Code of Criminal Procedure']",[],"The appellant company manufactures 'Pan Masala' in Assam, which is prohibited in Maharashtra.

The applicant was represented by Advocate Mr. C.C. Deshpande, while the State was represented by APP Mr. V.M. Kagne.

The court began by hearing the arguments from both sides. The learned APP opposed the bail application, citing that the matter was new and he had not yet received all relevant papers. The First Information Report (FIR) indicated the applicant's active involvement in the case, although it was noted that he was not present at the location where contraband articles were seized. The contraband in question was Gutkha, which is banned in Maharashtra but not in Gujarat, where the applicant's godown was located.

The applicant's counsel argued that since Gutkha is not banned in Gujarat, the connection to the applicant needed further examination before any conclusions could be drawn. The court decided to issue a notice to the respondent, with a return date set for March 25, 2022.

In the interim, the court granted anticipatory bail to the applicant, stating that in the event of his arrest in connection with Crime No.20/2022, he should be released on a personal bond of Rs.30,000 with two solvent sureties of Rs.15,000 each. The court imposed conditions on the bail, including that the applicant should not engage in any criminal activity, should not tamper with prosecution evidence, and must cooperate with the investigation by attending the Upnagar Police Station every Monday between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. until further orders.

The background of the case involved the seizure of a pick-up van loaded with prohibited **Pan Masala**, with two individuals, **Dashrath Ram** and **Ashish Mahto**, being apprehended. They identified **Dilip Kumar Yadav** as the owner of the vehicle, leading to his implication in the case. 

During the hearing, the petitioner's counsel argued that Yadav was innocent and had been falsely implicated, emphasizing that he was merely the owner of the vehicle and that no specific allegations were made against him. Furthermore, it was noted that Yadav had no prior criminal record, which was highlighted in the bail application. 

The **State's counsel**, represented by **Mr. Jharkhandi Upadhyay**, opposed the anticipatory bail request.

**Background:** Dilip Saha, a businessman and proprietor of M/s. Saha Pan Shop in Diphu, was accused of violating laws during the COVID-19 lockdown by selling illegal Gutka items. On **21 May 2020**, police seized a significant quantity of these products from his shop, leading to an FIR against him. Saha's initial zimma petition was rejected by the CJM on **8 June 2020**, and subsequent appeals to the Sessions Court were also denied. The matter was later remanded to the trial court by the High Court for reconsideration based on a notification from the Commissioner of Food Safety, Assam, which was set to expire after one year.

**Key Arguments:** Saha argued that the seized items were perishable and should be returned to him under Section 451 of the CrPC. He contended that the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act) and its regulations did not apply to tobacco products, which are governed by the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA). He claimed that the Commissioner of Food Safety lacked the authority to issue prohibitory notifications regarding these products.

**Court's Findings:** The court noted that the notification dated **12 January 2021**, which extended the prohibition on the sale of Gutka and Pan Masala, was still in effect. The court emphasized that the Commissioner of Food Safety had the authority under Section 30(2) of the FSS Act to prohibit the sale of food articles in the interest of public health. The court found no illegality in the trial court's refusal to grant zimma of the seized articles, as the prohibition was still valid.

**Conclusion:** The High Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts, stating that the petitioner could challenge the validity of the notification before the appropriate authority.

The petitioner had previously approached the court in W.P.No.8998 of 2021, resulting in an order on April 30, 2021, which prohibited authorities from interfering with his business due to the expiration of an earlier notification dated January 8, 2021.

The court examined the jurisdiction of the police officers involved in the seizure. It concluded that the police (respondent Nos. 5 and 6) did not have the authority to seize the tobacco products under the Food Safety and Standards Act or the new notification, especially since no formal complaint had been registered against the petitioner. The court emphasized that any seizure must be conducted under proper legal authority and procedure.

The petitioners, which included various companies and individuals involved in online gaming, challenged the amendments that criminalized online gaming activities, arguing that they violated fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India.

### Key Parties Involved:
- **Petitioners:** Galactus Funware Technology Private Limited, All India Gaming Federation, and several other companies and individuals associated with online gaming.
- **Respondents:** State of Karnataka, represented by the Chief Secretary and the Commissioner of Police.

### Background:
The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2021, amended the existing Karnataka Police Act, 1963, to include provisions that criminalized online gaming, including games of skill when played for stakes. The petitioners contended that the amendments were unconstitutional as they lacked legislative competence, were vague, arbitrary, and violated their rights to equality, freedom of speech, and personal liberty.

### Arguments by Petitioners:
1. **Lack of Legislative Competence:** The petitioners argued that the amendments did not fall under the legislative powers granted to the State under Entry 34 of the State List, which pertains to betting and gambling.
2. **Violation of Fundamental Rights:** They claimed that the amendments violated their rights under Articles 14 (equality), 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression), and 19(1)(g) (right to practice any profession or carry on any occupation, trade, or business).
3. **Manifest Arbitrariness:** The petitioners asserted that the law failed to distinguish between games of skill and games of chance, treating them as the same, which was contrary to established jurisprudence.
4. **Paternalism and Populism:** They argued that the law represented excessive paternalism, imposing the State's moral views on individuals without justifiable grounds.

### Arguments by Respondents:
1. **Public Interest:** The State argued that the amendments were necessary to protect public order and health, citing a rise in gambling-related issues and suicides linked to online gaming.
2. **Legislative Power:** The respondents contended that the State had the authority to legislate on matters affecting public order and health, and the amendments were a response to public demand for regulation of online gaming.
3. **No Coercive Action:** The State claimed that no coercive action had been taken against the petitioners, and thus they lacked standing to challenge the law.

### Court's Findings:
1. **Legislative Competence:** The Court found that the amendments were beyond the legislative competence of the State as they did not align with the constitutional provisions governing betting and gambling.
2. **Violation of Rights:** The Court held that the amendments violated the fundamental rights of the petitioners, particularly the right to carry on business and the right to freedom of speech and expression.
3. **Manifest Arbitrariness:** The Court noted that the law's failure to differentiate between games of skill and games of chance rendered it arbitrary and unconstitutional.
4. **Paternalism:** The Court criticized the paternalistic approach of the State in imposing a blanket ban on online gaming, which was deemed excessive and unjustified.

### Final Decision:
The High Court declared Sections 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 of the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2021, as ultra vires the Constitution and struck them down in their entirety. The Court issued a writ of mandamus restraining the respondents from interfering with the online gaming business and allied activities of the petitioners.

The FIR included allegations of selling sub-standard food articles, specifically ghee, and charged him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 272 (selling noxious food), 273 (sale of noxious food), and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed).  
  
**Arguments:**  
- **Applicant's Argument:**  
  - The applicant's counsel, Mr. M. A. Kharadi, argued that the allegations were already addressed under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act). The applicant had been penalized with a fine of Rs. 1,00,000 in a prior adjudication (Food Safety (Adjudicating) Case No.27/2016) for the same incident.  
  - Kharadi contended that since the FSS Act provides a specific mechanism for prosecution and penalties regarding food safety, invoking IPC provisions for the same incident constituted double jeopardy.  
  
- **Respondent's Argument:**  
  - The learned APP, Ms. Mehta, defended the FIR, asserting that the applicant's actions warranted IPC charges due to the nature of the offences committed.  
  
**Court's Analysis:**  
- The court noted that the core issue revolved around the alleged manufacture and sale of sub-standard food articles, which falls under the purview of the FSS Act.  
- The court highlighted Section 89 of the FSS Act, which states that the provisions of this Act override any other laws related to food articles. This indicates that the FSS Act is a special law that prevails over general laws like the IPC.  
- Citing the Supreme Court's ruling in *Sharat Babu Digumarti vs. Government (NCT of Delhi)*, the court reiterated that when a special law exists, it supersedes general laws in cases of conflict.  
- The court concluded that since the applicant had already faced proceedings under the FSS Act and was penalized, further prosecution under the IPC for the same incident was not permissible.  
  
**Decision:**  
The High Court quashed the FIR (C.R. No.I-30/2014) and any further proceedings arising from it, ruling in favor of the applicant. The application was allowed, and the rule was made absolute.  
  
**Conclusion:**  
The judgement emphasized the precedence of special laws over general laws in matters of food safety, affirming that once a specific legal framework (FSS Act) has been applied, further actions under general provisions (IPC) for the same incident are barred.",High Court of Gujarat,['Ghanshyambhai Dahyabhai Patel'],"['State of Gujarat', '1 other(s)']",['Nikhil S.

58,Goldripe_International_Pvt_Ltd_vs_The_State_Of_Telangana_on_19_January_2022.PDF,"**Case Summary: Goldripe International Pvt. Ltd vs The State Of Telangana (19 January 2022)**

**Court:** High Court of Telangana  
**Judges:** Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili  
**Case Numbers:** Writ Petition (PIL) No. 176 of 2020, Writ Petition Nos. 3272 and 3719 of 2021  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around the use of Ethephon, a chemical substance recognized as an insecticide, for artificially ripening fruits. The petitioners, including a director from a college and a retired trade union leader, challenged the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) directive dated 16 August 2018, which permitted the use of Ethephon for this purpose. They argued that Ethephon is hazardous and poses health risks, citing its classification as an insecticide under the Insecticides Act, 1968, and its corrosive properties.

**Key Arguments by Petitioners:**  
1. **Health Risks:** Ethephon is a corrosive phosphoric acid and can cause burns and other health issues.  
2. **Legal Violations:** The use of Ethephon violates Section 21(2) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which prohibits the use of insecticides on food.  
3. **Regulatory Non-compliance:** The petitioners claimed that the FSSAI's directive contradicts the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Regulations, 2011.

**Interventions:**  
- **Mr. Ravinder Kumar Nagpal:** An importer of Ethephon argued that the FSSAI had previously banned carbide gas for ripening fruits and allowed Ethephon as a safer alternative.  
- **M/s. Heighten Innovative Solutions Pvt. Ltd:** This company produces 'En-Ripe', a product deemed safe for ripening fruits, and supported the dismissal of the petition.

**FSSAI's Defense:**  
The FSSAI defended its directive by stating that:
1. Ethephon is used to generate Ethylene gas, which is essential for fruit ripening and is regulated under the Food Safety and Standards Act.  
2. The use of Ethephon is permitted only in controlled conditions, ensuring it does not come into direct contact with food.
3. The directive was based on scientific recommendations and aimed to curb the illegal use of carbide gas.

**Court's Findings:**  
1. The court noted that Ethephon is not being sprayed directly on fruits but is used in a controlled manner to generate Ethylene gas.  
2. The court found no conflict between the FSSAI's directive and existing laws, as Ethephon is stored and used according to safety guidelines.  
3. The court emphasized that the FSSAI has the authority to issue such directives under Section 16(5) of the Food Safety and Standards Act.

**Conclusion:**  
The court dismissed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) No. 176 of 2020, along with Writ Petitions Nos. 3272 and 3719 of 2021, stating that the use of Ethephon for ripening fruits does not violate any laws and is a regulated practice. The court concluded that there was no need to interfere with the FSSAI's directive, and no costs were awarded.",High Court of Telangana,['Goldripe International Pvt.

62,Haldiram_Bhujiawala_Limited_vs_The_State_Of_Jharkhand_Others_on_9_February_2022.PDF,"In the case of Haldiram Bhujiawala Limited vs The State of Jharkhand & Others, the petitioner, Haldiram Bhujiawala Limited, sought to quash an order dated July 27, 2018, issued by the Collector-cum-District Magistrate of Bokaro, which imposed a penalty of Rs. 50,000 on the petitioner for alleged misbranding of food products under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The case was presided over by Justice Kailash Prasad Deo in the High Court of Jharkhand on February 9, 2022.

The petitioner argued that the penalty was a result of high-handedness by the administrative officer, as no formal proceedings were initiated against them. The issue arose when certain food items were purchased from the petitioner’s outlet in Bokaro and subsequently sent for examination to the State Food and Drug Laboratory in Ranchi. The laboratory reported that the sample of Kaju Burfi was misbranded due to non-compliance with packaging and labeling regulations, specifically citing violations of several regulations under the Food Safety and Standards (Packing & Labelling) Regulations, 2011.

The petitioner’s counsel contended that the findings of misbranding were legally unfounded. They argued that the definition of misbranding under Section 3(1)(zf) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, was not met, as the alleged deficiencies (such as missing net weight, batch number, and date of packing) did not constitute misbranding when the food was sold loose. The petitioner maintained that the items were not packaged in a manner that would invoke the misbranding provisions of the Act.

The respondent's counsel, Ms. Shalini Sahdeo, argued that the petitioner failed to file a show cause notice before the competent authority, which justified the imposition of the penalty. However, the court found that the food articles were purchased loose and that the laboratory report did not substantiate the claim of misbranding as defined by law.

Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Haldiram Bhujiawala Limited, stating that no case of misbranding was established under the relevant provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act. The court concluded that the entire proceedings and the impugned order were invalid and thus allowed the writ petition, effectively quashing the penalty imposed on the petitioner.",HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI,['Haldiram Bhujiawala Limited'],"['The State of Jharkhand', 'Others']",['Kailash Prasad Deo'],09-02-2022,[],"['Jharkhand', 'Bokaro', 'Namkum', 'Ranchi']","['Section 3(1)(zf) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Section 23 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']",[],"Haldiram Bhujiawala Limited was penalized Rs. 50,000 for misbranding of Kaju Burfi.

**Findings of the Court:**  
1. **Failure of Municipal Authorities:** The court found that municipal authorities, including the Bhiwandi Nizampur Municipal Corporation (BNMC), had failed to take adequate action against illegal constructions despite being aware of their existence.  
2. **Lack of Accountability:** The court noted a systemic failure in holding municipal officers accountable for their inaction, which contributed to the unsafe living conditions in slum areas.  
3. **Need for Structural Audits:** The court emphasized the necessity of conducting structural audits for old and new buildings to ensure safety and prevent collapses.

1. **Data Collection:** Municipal corporations were directed to compile and present data on illegal constructions and actions taken against them.

7. **Formation of a Permanent Committee:** The court ordered the establishment of a Permanent Standing Committee to oversee encroachment prevention efforts.

**Court:** High Court of Delhi  
**Judges:** Chief Justice D. N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh  
**Case Numbers:** LPA 24/2021, LPA 30/2021, LPA 31/2021  
**Date Reserved:** 24 November 2021  
**Date Pronounced:** 10 January 2022  

### Background  
The case involves appeals by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and other Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) against a judgment by a Single Judge of the High Court, which had struck down or read down certain amendments made to the Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDGs) in 2017. The amendments were aimed at regulating the operations of petrol and diesel retail outlets (ROs) and ensuring compliance with labor laws, including the payment of minimum wages and the provision of employee benefits.

### Key Parties  
- **Appellants:** Indian Oil Corporation Limited and others (OMCs)  
- **Respondents:** All India Petroleum Dealers Association and others (RO Dealers)  

### Key Issues  
1. **Authority to Amend MDGs:** The appellants argued that the amendments to the MDGs were within their contractual rights as per the dealership agreements with the ROs. They contended that the Single Judge erred in invalidating these amendments, which were made to enhance service standards and protect consumer interests.
2. **Payment of Higher Wages:** The amendments mandated that ROs pay wages higher than the statutory minimum, which the respondents contested as being beyond the authority of the OMCs.
3. **Penalties for Non-Compliance:** The appellants defended the imposition of penalties for various irregularities, arguing that these were necessary to maintain discipline and protect consumer interests.
4. **Provision of Clean Toilet Facilities:** The requirement for ROs to provide clean toilet facilities was also contested, with the respondents arguing that access should be limited to employees and customers only.

### Arguments  
- **For the Appellants:**  
  - The OMCs have the authority to issue and amend MDGs under the dealership agreements, which are binding on the ROs.  
  - The amendments were made in response to malpractices and aimed at improving service quality and employee welfare.  
  - The increase in dealer margins factored in the higher wages and benefits, ensuring that ROs would not suffer financially from the amendments.  
  - The penalties imposed for non-compliance were necessary to deter malpractices and ensure adherence to the guidelines.

- **For the Respondents:**  
  - The amendments effectively rewrote the dealership contracts, imposing obligations that were not agreed upon.  
  - The requirement to pay higher wages and provide benefits was seen as an overreach of the OMCs' authority, especially since not all ROs employed the minimum number of workers required by law to be covered under certain labor statutes.  
  - The penalties were viewed as excessive and potentially abusive, leading to harassment of the dealers.

### Court's Analysis  
- The Court upheld the authority of the OMCs to amend the MDGs, emphasizing that the amendments were made in the interest of consumer protection and employee welfare.  
- It found that the requirement to pay higher wages was not in violation of the Minimum Wages Act, as employers can pay above the minimum wage if stipulated in a contract.  
- The Court ruled that the penalties for non-compliance were justified and necessary to maintain standards and protect consumers.  
- Regarding the provision of clean toilet facilities, the Court agreed with the Single Judge's reading down of the clause, allowing discretion to the ROs regarding access to non-customers.

**Court:** High Court of Delhi  
**Judges:** Chief Justice D. N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh  
**Date of Judgment:** January 10, 2022  

**Background:**  
The case involves appeals by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and other Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) against a judgment by a Single Judge that struck down certain amendments to the Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDGs) issued in 2017. The amendments were aimed at regulating the operations of petrol and diesel retail outlets (ROs) and ensuring compliance with labor laws, including the payment of minimum wages and the provision of employee benefits.  

**Key Parties:**  
- **Appellants:** Indian Oil Corporation Limited and others (OMCs)  
- **Respondents:** All India Petroleum Dealers Association and others (RO Dealers)  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Authority to Amend MDGs:** The appellants argued that the amendments to the MDGs were within their contractual rights as per the dealership agreements with the ROs. They contended that the relationship was governed by contract law, allowing them to issue and amend guidelines to ensure compliance and protect consumer interests.  
2. **Payment of Higher Wages:** The amendments mandated that ROs pay wages higher than the statutory minimum, which the respondents contested as being beyond the authority of the OMCs.  
3. **Short Delivery of Products:** The guidelines required recalibration and re-stamping of dispensing units even for short deliveries within permissible limits, which the respondents argued was impractical.  
4. **E-Payment for Salaries:** The requirement for salaries to be paid through electronic means was challenged on the grounds of practicality, especially in remote areas.  
5. **Provision of Clean Toilet Facilities:** The guidelines mandated that ROs provide clean toilet facilities accessible to the public, which the respondents argued could pose security risks.  

**Arguments:**  
- **For the Appellants:**  
  - The OMCs have the authority to issue and amend MDGs under the dealership agreements.  
  - The amendments are in the public interest, aimed at improving service standards and protecting employee rights.  
  - The increase in dealer margins compensates for the higher wages mandated by the amendments.  
  - The guidelines on recalibration and e-payment are necessary for maintaining standards and transparency.  

- **For the Respondents:**  
  - The amendments effectively rewrite the dealership contracts and impose unreasonable obligations.  
  - The requirement to pay higher wages and implement e-payments is impractical and not legally enforceable.  
  - The guidelines on toilet facilities could lead to security issues for the dealers.  

**Court's Analysis:**  
- The court upheld the authority of the OMCs to issue and amend the MDGs, emphasizing the contractual nature of the relationship with the ROs.  
- It found that the amendments aimed to ensure compliance with labor laws and improve service standards, which are in line with the welfare objectives of the state.  
- The court ruled that the requirement for recalibration and e-payments, while stringent, was justified in the interest of consumer protection and employee welfare.  
- The court agreed with the respondents regarding the discretion of ROs in providing toilet facilities, allowing for a reading down of that specific clause.  

**Conclusion:**  
The High Court partly allowed the appeals, upholding most of the amendments to the MDGs while reading down the provision regarding public access to toilet facilities. The judgment of the Single Judge was set aside, affirming the OMCs' authority to regulate the operations of ROs through the MDGs.",High Court of Delhi,"['Indian Oil Corporation Limited', 'Indian Oil Corporation']","['All India Petroleum Dealers Association', 'All Haryana Petroleum Dealers Association', 'Bihar Petroleum Dealers Association']","['D.

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Authority of OMCs to Amend MDGs:** The appellants claimed that the OMCs had the authority to issue and amend the MDGs under the Dealership Agreements, which were binding on the dealers. The respondents argued that the amendments effectively rewrote the contracts and imposed obligations that were not legally enforceable.
2. **Payment of Higher Wages:** The amendments mandated that dealers pay wages higher than the statutory minimum, which the respondents contested as being beyond the OMCs' authority.
3. **Short Delivery of Products:** The guidelines required recalibration and re-stamping of dispensing units even for short deliveries within permissible limits, which the respondents argued was impractical.

- **For the Appellants:**  
  - The OMCs have the contractual authority to issue and amend the MDGs to ensure compliance and protect consumer interests.  
  - The amendments were made in response to malpractices detected in the industry and aimed at improving service standards.

- The amendments were aimed at ensuring better service and compliance with statutory obligations.  
- The requirement to pay higher wages was not in violation of the Minimum Wages Act, as it allowed for higher payments than the statutory minimum.  
- The guidelines regarding recalibration were justified in the interest of consumer protection and maintaining standards.  
- The e-payment requirement was deemed a reasonable measure to ensure transparency and accountability in wage payments.  
- The imposition of penalties was upheld as a necessary measure to enforce compliance and maintain discipline among dealers.  

**Conclusion:**

The writ petition was filed to address the challenges faced by child victims and witnesses of human trafficking, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The petition sought directions for the recording of evidence via video conferencing to avoid the need for children to travel long distances to courts, which could expose them to further trauma and risk.

**Reliefs Sought:**  
1. Directing that evidence of child victims/witnesses be recorded via video conferencing from local government facilities during the pandemic.  
2. Ensuring that this practice continues post-pandemic.

- The pilot project involved two cases of child trafficking, where children had been rescued from exploitative labor conditions.  
- The Amicus Curiae outlined a three-stage process for the pilot project, focusing on assessing infrastructure, scheduling witness examinations, and conducting the actual video conferencing.

**Nature of the Case:**  
The case involves a petition filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking to set aside an arbitral award dated 01.06.2017 passed by a sole arbitrator.

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Aurangabad Bench  
**Date of Judgment:** 10 February 2022  
**Judge:** Smt. Vibha Kankanwadi  
**Case Number:** Anticipatory Bail Application No. 1630 of 2021  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Applicant:** Israr Mansoori Mustaq Mansoori  
- **Respondent:** The State of Maharashtra  

**Background:**  
The applicant, Israr Mansoori, sought anticipatory bail in connection with Crime No. 106 of 2021 registered at Shirpur Taluka Police Station, Dhule. The charges against him included violations of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) under Sections 188, 272, 273, and 328, as well as various sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The case arose from the apprehension of two individuals, Ajim Wahid Shaikh and Akram Shabbir Ali, who were found transporting banned Gutka (tobacco) packets. They allegedly implicated the applicant, claiming he was behind the transportation of these banned items.  

**Arguments Presented:**  
- **For the Applicant:**  
  - The applicant's counsel argued that the FIR primarily implicated the two individuals caught with the banned items, and there was no direct evidence linking the applicant to the crime.  
  - The vehicle used for transporting the Gutka was not owned by the applicant but by his brother, which further weakened the prosecution's case against him.  
  - The counsel contended that the custodial interrogation of the applicant was unnecessary as there was no substantial evidence against him.  
  - The applicant's counsel also referenced previous judgments where similar charges were dismissed, arguing that the offence under Section 328 of the IPC was not applicable in this case.  

- **For the Respondent (State):**  
  - The learned APP opposed the bail application, emphasizing the public health concerns associated with the banned tobacco products.  
  - The prosecution maintained that the statements from the co-accused indicated the applicant's involvement in the transportation of the banned goods, necessitating his custodial interrogation to uncover further details about his operations.  
  - The State argued that the vehicle's ownership by the applicant's brother did not absolve the applicant of responsibility, as it was used for illegal activities at his behest.  

**Court's Analysis:**  
- The court noted that while the statements of co-accused could be considered, their evidentiary value was limited without further corroboration.  
- The court acknowledged conflicting precedents regarding the applicability of Section 328 of the IPC in similar cases but leaned towards the interpretation that the offence was not made out in this instance, given that the Gutka was being transported from a state where its sale was not banned.  
- The court concluded that there was insufficient material to connect the applicant directly to the crime, and thus, custodial interrogation was not warranted.  

**Final Decision:**  
- The anticipatory bail application was granted.  
- In the event of the applicant's arrest, he was to be released on a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with two solvent sureties of Rs. 15,000 each.  
- The applicant was required to report to the Shirpur Taluka Police Station every Monday between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. until the charge-sheet was filed and was instructed not to tamper with any evidence.

Haripal, heard the case of Jacob Thomas vs. Food Safety Officer Kuttiadi Circle, concerning a criminal miscellaneous case (Crl.MC No.1855/2022) related to the marketing of unsafe Kashmiri chilli powder. The applicants in this case included Jacob Thomas, who is the nominee of the company that marketed the unsafe product, M/s Intergrow Brands (P) Ltd., and other individuals associated with the manufacturing of the chilli powder, including Anil Kumar and Synthite Industries Pvt. Ltd.

The respondents included the Food Safety Officer of the Kuttiadi Circle, the State of Kerala represented by the Public Prosecutor, and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The case arose from allegations regarding the safety and quality of the Kashmiri chilli powder marketed by the applicants.

During the proceedings, the court admitted the case and heard arguments from both sides. The petitioners were represented by Advocate Premjit Nagendran, while the respondents were represented by the Senior Public Prosecutor and the Standing Counsel for FSSAI.

The court decided to grant an interim stay on further proceedings in the lower court case (C.C. No. 585/2021) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court in Vatakara for a period of ten weeks. This stay allows the petitioners some relief from the ongoing legal proceedings while the case is under consideration by the High Court.

He had been arrested on January 4, 2021, in connection with Crime No. 3/2021 at Police Station Pahargarh, District Morena, for offenses under Sections 420, 272, and 273 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as Sections 51, 57, 59, and 63 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The applicant's counsel argued that Dhakad was falsely implicated and had not committed any offense. He highlighted that the trial court had only framed charges under the IPC and not under the Food Safety and Standards Act. Furthermore, a scientific report indicated that the seized articles were sub-standard but not adulterated. The applicant had been in custody for over a year and was willing to comply with any conditions imposed by the court if bail were granted.

The State's counsel opposed the bail application, noting that this was the seventh request and that the fifth application had been rejected on September 8, 2021, after considering the merits of the case. The State argued that there had been no change in circumstances to warrant a new consideration for bail.

After reviewing the case diary and documents, the court noted that the initial FIR included charges under both the IPC and the Food Safety Act.

He was arrested in connection with Crime No. 3/2021 at Police Station Pahadgarh, District Morena, facing charges under Sections 420, 272, 273 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 51, 57, 59, 63 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The applicant's counsel argued that the trial court had only framed charges under the IPC sections, and the forensic report indicated that only sub-standard milk was involved, with witnesses turning hostile and not supporting the prosecution's case. The counsel emphasized that the IPC sections under which the applicant was charged were bailable and that the applicant was willing to comply with any conditions imposed by the court if bail were granted.

In contrast, the State's counsel opposed the bail application, highlighting that this was the seventh application and that previous applications had been rejected. The State argued that the gravity of the offences, particularly the presence of formalin in the milk as per the FSL report, warranted the rejection of bail.

The court noted that the trial court had not provided a cogent reason for not framing charges under the Food Safety and Standards Act, despite the initial charge sheet including those sections. The High Court directed that an explanation be sought from the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) regarding the non-framing of charges under the Food Safety and Standards Act.

The court scheduled the next hearing for February 11, 2022, and ordered the registry to send a copy of the order to the District Judge (Inspection) and the concerned JMFC for compliance.

**Date of Judgment:** February 4, 2022  
**Court:** High Court of Delhi  
**Judge:** Hon'ble Ms. Justice Rekha Palli  

**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioners:** JMC Projects (India) Ltd. & Ors.  
- **Respondents:** National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) & Ors.  

**Background:**  
The petitioners challenged a communication dated November 18, 2021, from NHAI, which denied security clearance for a joint venture (JV) bid submitted by JMC-AGE Joint Venture (comprising JMC Projects and Turkish company AGE INSAAT). The denial of security clearance by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) led to the rejection of the petitioners' bid, despite being the lowest bidder (L-1) for a highway construction project in Jammu and Kashmir.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Applicability of Security Clearance Clause:** The primary contention was whether the security clearance requirement under clause 2.1.12(a) of the Request for Proposal (RFP) applied to the petitioners, given that the Turkish company held only 26% of the JV.  
2. **Discriminatory Treatment:** The petitioners argued that the NHAI's decision was arbitrary and discriminatory, especially since the L-2 bidder (Tata Projects) had a Ukrainian partner, which allegedly did not require security clearance.  

**Arguments by Petitioners:**  
- The petitioners contended that the RFP clause regarding security clearance was misapplied, as the Turkish company did not hold a controlling interest (50% or more) in the JV.  
- They argued that the Turkish company had successfully executed other projects in India, which should have warranted security clearance.  
- The petitioners highlighted that the L-2 bidder was not subjected to the same scrutiny, indicating a lack of consistency in the application of the security clearance requirement.  

**Arguments by Respondents:**  
- The NHAI maintained that the security clearance was necessary due to the Turkish company's foreign ownership, which fell under the RFP's security clause.  
- They argued that the decision was made in public interest, considering national security concerns and inputs from security agencies.  
- The NHAI also claimed that the L-2 bidder's Ukrainian partner did not require security clearance based on prior government instructions.  

**Judgment:**  
- The court upheld the NHAI's interpretation of the RFP clause, stating that security clearance was indeed required for any member of the JV controlled by foreign entities, regardless of the percentage of ownership.  
- The court found that the NHAI's decision to award the contract to the L-2 bidder without seeking security clearance was arbitrary and discriminatory, given the lack of a consistent application of the rules.  
- However, the court decided against quashing the entire RFP or re-tendering the project, emphasizing the importance of public interest and the need for timely completion of the highway project.  
- Instead, the court directed the NHAI to seek security clearance for the L-2 bidder and mandated a decision from the MHA within three weeks. If security clearance was denied, the NHAI could proceed to award the contract to the next eligible bidder.  

**Conclusion:**  
The court rejected the petitioners' challenge to the communication denying security clearance but mandated that the NHAI seek security clearance for the L-2 bidder, balancing the need for compliance with the RFP and the urgency of the public project.",High Court of Delhi,"['JMC Projects (India) Ltd.', 'AGE INSAAT VE TICARET ANONIM SIRKETI']","['National Highways Authority of India', 'Ministry of Home Affairs', 'Tata Projects Limited - Private Joint Company Construction Association Interbudmontazh']",['Rekha Palli'],04-02-2022,"['National Highways Authority of India', 'Ministry of Home Affairs']","['Jammu and Kashmir', 'India']","['Section 226 of Constitution of India', 'Clause 2.1.12(a) of RFP']","['National Highways Authority of India Act, 1988']","['Antaios Compania Navierya S A v.

The allegations against the petitioner included the preparation and sale of adulterated food products, specifically chilli, turmeric, coriander powder, and a probiotic health mix, which were claimed to be injurious to human health. The petitioner was accused of cheating the public by selling spurious food items that lacked the original quality, violating several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, as well as the Legal Metrology Act.

The petitioner's counsel argued that Jyotirmayee Rout held a valid license to sell food products and noted that some co-accused had already been granted bail. The counsel requested that the petitioner be allowed to surrender to the lower court and apply for bail, emphasizing the principle of parity with the co-accused.

In response, the State's counsel informed the court that samples from the seized products had been sent for testing to the Forensic Science Laboratory.

After considering the severity of the accusations, Justice S.K. Sahoo declined to grant anticipatory bail. However, the court allowed the petitioner to surrender within four weeks and apply for bail in the lower court, directing that the bail application be disposed of expeditiously, taking into account the claims of parity with the co-accused who had been released on bail.

No. 145 of 2022 registered at the Vizianagaram I Town Police Station. The FIR charged him with offences under Sections 269 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and various sections of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. The total value of the seized property, which included tobacco products, was stated to be Rs. 1,33,070.

During the hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the case was similar to previous cases where the High Court had quashed FIRs based on identical facts, specifically referencing Criminal Petition Nos. 5421 of 2019 and others. The counsel further cited a ruling from Crl.P.No. 3731 of 2018, which established that the police lacked jurisdiction to investigate offences under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and that the transport or storage of tobacco products did not constitute an offence under Sections 270 to 273 of the IPC.

**Court:** High Court of Andhra Pradesh  
**Judges:** Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M. Satyanarayana Murthy  
**Case Numbers:** Writ Petition (PIL) No. 164 of 2019 and Writ Petition (PIL) No. 236 of 2021  
**Petitioners:**  
1. Karukola Simhachalam, Advocate, High Court of Andhra Pradesh  
2. Annepu Mahandhata  
**Respondents:** Union of India, represented by the Secretary, Health & Family Welfare Department, and various state officials.

### Background:
The petitions were filed as Public Interest Litigations (PILs) concerning the alarming prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), specifically termed ""Uddanam Nephropathy,"" in the Uddanam area of Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh. The petitioners alleged that the government had failed to take adequate measures to address this public health crisis, which has reportedly affected thousands of residents, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.

### Key Allegations:
1. **Lack of Awareness and Screening:** The petitioners sought directions for national surveys to determine the prevalence of CKD and to raise public awareness about its symptoms and treatment options.
2. **Healthcare Accessibility:** They argued for the provision of free medicines and treatment for CKD patients at all healthcare facilities in the Uddanam area.
3. **Food Safety Measures:** The petitioners requested the appointment of food inspectors to combat food adulteration, which they believed contributed to health issues in the region.
4. **Infrastructure Development:** They called for the establishment of a super specialty hospital with adequate dialysis units and testing laboratories in Uddanam.
5. **Community Rehabilitation:** The petitions also emphasized the need for community-based rehabilitation schemes for affected families and the provision of mobile dialysis units.

### Government Response:
The government, through various affidavits, acknowledged the severity of CKD in Uddanam and outlined several measures taken, including:
- Establishment of dialysis centers and a super specialty hospital.
- Initiatives to provide safe drinking water through Reverse Osmosis plants.
- Awareness campaigns and mass screening programs conducted in the area.
- Financial assistance schemes for CKD patients.

### Court's Findings:
1. **Right to Health:** The court emphasized that the right to health is integral to the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. It noted that the state has a constitutional obligation to provide adequate healthcare facilities.
2. **Inadequate Measures:** The court found that while some measures had been taken, they were insufficient to address the scale of the CKD crisis. The lack of a comprehensive strategy to identify and mitigate the causes of CKD was particularly concerning.
3. **Environmental Concerns:** The court highlighted the need for scientific investigations into environmental factors contributing to CKD, such as contaminated drinking water and occupational hazards.
4. **Recommendations for Action:** The court issued a series of directives to the state and central governments, including:
   - Immediate action to prevent pollution from local industries.
   - Ensuring emergency medical care is available to CKD patients.
   - Establishing a centralized communication system for patient referrals.
   - Conducting awareness programs about the health risks associated with certain lifestyle choices.
   - Continuous monitoring and reporting of health measures in Uddanam.

### Conclusion:
The court concluded that the state had failed to fulfill its constitutional obligations regarding public health and directed the government to take immediate and effective measures to combat CKD in Uddanam.

**Court:** High Court of Karnataka, Dharwad Bench  
**Judges:** Justice Suraj Govindaraj and Justice J.M. Khazi  
**Case Number:** Crl.A. No.100106/2016  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Appellants:** Kenchanagoudra Basavarajappa @ Basappa and others (total of 6 accused)  
- **Respondent:** The State of Karnataka  

**Background:**  
The appellants challenged the conviction and sentencing by the III Additional District and Sessions Judge, Ballari, which found them guilty of various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including murder (Section 302), rioting (Section 148), and criminal trespass (Section 448). The trial court sentenced them to life imprisonment and fines for the murder charge, among other penalties.

**Prosecution Case:**  
The prosecution alleged that on 25 July 2010, a quarrel erupted over the adulteration of milk, leading to a violent confrontation at the complainant's house around midnight. The accused allegedly formed an unlawful assembly, trespassed into the complainant's home, and assaulted several individuals, resulting in the death of Kamaraj (the deceased) and injuries to others. The complainant, Kadlenni Basappa, filed a complaint shortly after the incident, leading to the registration of a case.

**Key Evidence Presented:**  
- Testimonies from 24 witnesses, including family members of the deceased and injured parties, were presented.  
- Medical evidence indicated that Kamaraj sustained severe head injuries, leading to his death days later.  
- The prosecution claimed that the accused used weapons such as sticks and an axe during the assault.

**Defence Arguments:**  
The defence, represented by counsel K.L. Patil, argued that:  
1. The prosecution's case relied heavily on interested witnesses (family members), with no independent witnesses examined.  
2. There were inconsistencies in witness testimonies regarding the timing and nature of the incident.  
3. The FIR was delayed, and the evidence presented was not corroborated by physical evidence from the scene.  
4. Medical reports showed discrepancies in the nature of injuries, raising doubts about the prosecution's claims.

**Judgment:**  
The High Court found significant inconsistencies and gaps in the prosecution's case, including:  
- Contradictory timelines regarding the incident and the arrival of police and ambulance.  
- Lack of independent witness testimonies, despite claims of numerous villagers being present.  
- Discrepancies in medical evidence regarding the nature and timing of injuries.  
- The trial court's reliance on interested witnesses without corroborating evidence was deemed insufficient for a conviction.

**Final Decision:**  
The High Court allowed the appeal, acquitting all accused of the charges due to insufficient evidence and giving them the benefit of the doubt. The court also directed the Director General of Police to initiate proceedings against the investigating officers for mishandling the investigation and to implement better training and procedures for future cases.","HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA, DHARWAD BENCH","['KENCHANAGOUDRA BASAVARAJAPPA @ BASAPPA', 'GIRISH S/O KENCHANAGOUDRA BASAPPA', 'KANTESH S/O KENCHANAGOUDRA BASAPPA', 'KARIYAPPA S/O VIRUPAKSHAPPA', 'RUDRAPPA S/O VIRUPAKSHAPPA', 'RAMESH S/O VIRUPAKSHAPPA']",['THE STATE OF KARNATAKA'],"['SURAJ GOVINDARAJ', 'J.M.KHAZI']",17-03-2022,[],"['KARNATAKA', 'BALLARI', 'HOLALU VILLAGE', 'HADAGALI', 'DAVANAGERE']","['Section 148 of IPC', 'Section 448 of IPC', 'Section 302 of IPC', 'Section 307 of IPC', 'Section 149 of IPC']","['Indian Penal Code', 'Code of Criminal Procedure']",[],"The appellants were convicted for offences under Sections 148, 448, 302, 307 read with Section 149 of IPC.

**Case Reference:** Crl.O.P.(MD)No.2873 of 2021 and CRL.M.P.(MD)Nos.1535 and 1536 of 2021  

**Background:**  
The petitioners sought to quash the proceedings in S.T.C.No.222 of 2020 pending before the Judicial Magistrate Court, Vadipatti, Madurai. The prosecution was initiated under Sections 51, 59(i), and 63 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, alleging violations related to food safety.  

**Arguments:**  
- The petitioners' counsel argued that the sample taken by the Food Safety Officer was ""Turmeric Dust Powder,"" which should not be classified as food but rather as a waste product. Therefore, the petitioners contended that they could not be prosecuted under Sections 51 and 59(i) of the Act, as these sections pertain to food items.  
- The court noted that the sample was indeed labeled as ""Turmeric Dust Powder"" in Form V A, and since it was not defined as food, the prosecution under Sections 51 and 59(i) was questionable.  
- However, the petitioners failed to provide any evidence of a valid license for the premises from which the sample was taken. The court emphasized that without such a license, the argument regarding the first petitioner, Kanniyappan, being the nominee responsible for compliance could not absolve the directors from liability.  

**Judgment:**  
- The court decided to quash the proceedings concerning Sections 51 and 59(i) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, acknowledging the lack of evidence that the sample constituted food.  
- Conversely, the court upheld the proceedings under Section 63 of the Act, indicating that the petitioners would still face prosecution for this section.  
- The petition was partly allowed, and the connected miscellaneous petitions were closed.  

**Conclusion:**  
The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court ruled that while the petitioners were not liable under Sections 51 and 59(i) of the Food Safety and Standards Act due to the classification of the sample, they must still face prosecution under Section 63 of the Act.",Madurai Bench of Madras High Court,"['K.Kanniyappan', 'S.L.Sethu Madhava', 'S.Vasumathi', 'Chakra Drugs (P) Ltd.']","['The Food Safety Officer, Madurai Corporation']",['G.R.Swaminathan'],12-01-2022,"['Chakra Drugs (P) Ltd.', 'Food Safety and Drug Administration Department']","['Madurai', 'Tamilnadu']","['Section 51 of Food Safety and Standards Act', 'Section 59(i) of Food Safety and Standards Act', 'Section 63 of Food Safety and Standards Act']",['Food Safety and Standards Act'],[],"The petitioners were accused of offences under the Food Safety and Standards Act for a sample taken that was identified as 'Turmeric Dust Powder'.

  4. Chakra Drugs (P) Ltd.  
- **Respondent/Complainant:** The Food Safety Officer, Madurai Corporation  

**Background:**  
The petitioners filed a criminal original petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the proceedings in S.T.C.No.229 of 2020, which was initiated based on a private complaint by the Food Safety Officer. The complaint alleged violations under Sections 51 and 59(i) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, following an inspection on June 19, 2019, where a sample of ""Whole Turmeric Finger"" from Chakra Drugs (P) Ltd. was found to be substandard and unsafe.

**Arguments:**  
- The petitioners contended that the first petitioner, K.Kanniyappan, was the nominated officer responsible for the operations of the company, and thus, only he and the company should be prosecuted. They cited several legal precedents, including a Supreme Court ruling (AIR 1992 SC 1168) which stated that only a valid nominee can be prosecuted in such cases, not the directors unless specific allegations are made against them.
- The respondent's counsel argued that the premises were unlicensed, but acknowledged that the complaint was not filed under Section 63 of the Act, which pertains to operating without a license.

**Judgment:**  
The court ruled in favor of the petitioners in part. It held that:
- The proceedings against the second and third petitioners (S.L.Sethu Madhava and S.Vasumathi) were quashed due to the lack of specific allegations against them, affirming that only the nominated officer (K.Kanniyappan) and the company (Chakra Drugs (P) Ltd.) could face prosecution.
- The first petitioner and the company must establish their defense in a regular trial, and all defenses and contentions of the first petitioner and the company were left open for consideration.

Bhadang, addressed an anticipatory bail application filed by the applicant, Lalit Chandrakant Madhavi, on March 8, 2022. The applicant was apprehending arrest in connection with an investigation related to Crime No. 14/2020 at Police Station Karkamb, District Solapur (Rural). The charges against him were under various sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including allegations of selling adulterating substances for the manufacture of artificial milk.

The case stemmed from a raid conducted between January 10 and 11, 2020, at the Shree Ram Milk Collection Centre, where significant quantities of materials used for milk adulteration were seized, including whole milk powder, whey permeate powder, lactose powder, liquid paraffin, sorbitol, and melamine, valued at over Rs. 4,00,000. The informant alleged that Madhavi sold melamine powder to co-accused Dattatray Mahadeo Jadhav without any documentation.

Madhavi's counsel argued that there was no evidence, such as bills or invoices, to prove that he supplied melamine to Jadhav, and emphasized that no adulterating materials were recovered from Madhavi himself. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) noted that the investigation was complete and a chargesheet had been filed.

The court observed that there was no recovery of any adulterating materials from Madhavi, and he had been under interim protection from arrest since March 23, 2020. Given these circumstances, the court granted anticipatory bail to Madhavi, stipulating that he would be released on bail if arrested, upon executing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties. Additionally, he was ordered to report to the Investigating Officer on specified dates and cooperate with the investigation.

The petitioner claimed that the land in question (Sy.No.116/16D) was private 'zirayati' land, purchased by Srinivas Babu from the original owner, Kona Atchanna, and that she had leased the property to establish a coffee shop. She had obtained a valid license under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, allowing her to operate a food business until November 29, 2018.

The controversy arose when the Tahsildar, R. Narasimha Murthy, issued a notice on January 3, 2014, requiring the petitioner to present land and agreement documents for an inquiry scheduled for January 4, 2014. Despite the petitioner providing the necessary documents, the Tahsildar attempted to demolish her hut on January 6, 2014, prompting the writ petition.

In response, the Tahsildar's counter-affidavit stated that the land was recorded under the names of several pattadars and was located within the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). The Tahsildar argued that the petitioner had constructed a semi-permanent structure without the necessary permissions from the relevant authorities (CRDA/VUDA/GVMC) and was operating a commercial unit in violation of CRZ regulations. The Tahsildar also mentioned complaints from local residents regarding the illegal construction.

The court, presided over by Justice Kongara Vijaya Lakshmi, noted the allegations of encroachment and violations of CRZ regulations.

**Date:** 19 January 2022  
**Judges:** Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili  
**Case Numbers:** Writ Petition (PIL) No. 176 of 2020, Writ Petition Nos. 3272 and 3719 of 2021  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around the use of Ethephon, a chemical substance recognized as an insecticide, for artificially ripening fruits. The petitioners, who are public-spirited individuals, challenged the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) directive dated 16 August 2018, which permitted the use of Ethephon for this purpose. They argued that Ethephon is hazardous and poses health risks, citing its classification as an insecticide under the Insecticides Act, 1968, and its corrosive properties. They contended that its use violates Section 21(2) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and Regulation 2.3.14(1) of the FSS (Prohibition) Regulations, which prohibit the use of insecticides on food.  

**Interventions:**  
Two applications for intervention were filed:  
1. **Mr. Ravinder Kumar Nagpal** (importer of Ethephon) argued that Ethephon is not sprayed on fruits but used to generate Ethylene gas safely.  
2. **M/s. Heighten Innovative Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** claimed that their product, En-Ripe, is a safe alternative for ripening fruits and has been certified by FSSAI.  

**FSSAI's Defense:**  
The FSSAI defended its directive, stating that Ethephon is used under controlled conditions to generate Ethylene gas, which is essential for fruit ripening. They highlighted that the use of Ethephon is regulated and does not involve direct contact with consumable food. The FSSAI's decision was based on scientific research and expert opinions, and they argued that the guidelines were established to prevent the illegal use of more harmful substances like carbide gas.  

**Court's Findings:**  
The court, after reviewing the arguments and evidence, concluded that:  
- Ethephon is not being sold or stored alongside consumable fruits, and its use is regulated under FSSAI guidelines.  
- The FSSAI has the authority to issue directives under Section 16(5) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, which allows them to regulate food safety matters.  
- The court found no conflict between the FSSAI's guidelines and the provisions of the Insecticides Act or the Food Safety and Standards Act.  
- The court noted that the FSSAI's guidelines were established to ensure safe practices in fruit ripening and to replace more dangerous methods.  

**Conclusion:**  
The court dismissed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) No. 176 of 2020 and the two writ petitions (Nos. 3272 and 3719 of 2021) challenging the Telangana government's order promoting En-Ripe, stating that it did not restrict the use of Ethephon. The court ruled that the FSSAI's directive was valid and did not pose a health risk when used as specified.

The appellants were convicted and fined Rs. 3,00,000 for violations related to food safety, specifically concerning a sample of semolina (Chetak Suji) taken from a grocery shop owned by Bundram Sao, one of the respondents.

The key argument presented by the appellants was that the sample was taken on November 21, 2017, but the complaint was filed over a year later, on December 5, 2018. They contended that this delay violated Section 77 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, which requires timely action, and that no extension had been granted by the Commissioner of Food Safety with justifiable reasons.

The court acknowledged the merits of the appellants' argument regarding the timing of the complaint and the lack of extension. It noted that the fine sentence had previously been suspended by the Appellate Authority on February 4, 2021, indicating that the case warranted further consideration.

Consequently, the court allowed the application for suspension of the fine sentence during the pendency of the appeal, provided that the appellants furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two sureties of Rs. 50,000 each. The appellants were ordered to appear before the court on March 4, 2022, and continue to appear as directed until the appeal's resolution.

**Background:**  
Mahesh Garg filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the implementation of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 in Madhya Pradesh, specifically for the establishment of Food Testing Laboratories in Indore, Jabalpur, Ujjain, and Gwalior. He argued that the lack of sufficient laboratories was leading to delays in food safety testing, which in turn allowed offenders to evade justice due to the expiration of food articles' shelf life before testing could be completed.  

**Key Arguments:**  
- The petitioner highlighted that only one out of three sanctioned Food Testing Laboratories was operational in Bhopal, while those in Indore and Ujjain were not constructed.  
- He emphasized the need for tools for Food Safety Officers to conduct preliminary examinations of food articles to combat food adulteration effectively.  
- The petitioner provided data indicating that around 50% of food samples tested were not meeting safety standards due to inadequate testing facilities.  

**Respondents' Position:**  
- The FSSAI acknowledged the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act and stated that a scheme for strengthening food safety norms was being implemented, which included the establishment of mobile food testing laboratories and funding for state laboratories.  
- The State Government reported that they had created posts for Food Safety Officers and were in the process of establishing the necessary infrastructure for the laboratories.  
- They also mentioned that construction for the Indore laboratory was underway, with 80% of the work completed as of December 2021, and that they aimed to have it operational by the end of 2022.

**Date of Judgment:** 18 February 2022  

**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioners:**  
  1. M/s. Mangalagiri Textile Mills Private Limited, represented by its Chairman, Dr. Goli Nagasaina Rao.  
  2. Dr. Goli Nagasaina Rao, Chairman and Managing Director of M/s. Mangalagiri Textile Mills Private Limited.  
- **Respondents:**  
  1. The State Bank of India, represented by its Authorized Officer, Stressed Assets Management Branch - II.  
  2. The Authorized Officer, State Bank of India.  

**Background:**  
The petitioners, Mangalagiri Textile Mills, had taken a loan from the State Bank of India (SBI), which later became a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). They applied for a One-Time Settlement (OTS) to pay off the dues, which was initially sanctioned. However, due to a default in payment, SBI canceled the OTS and sought to take possession of the secured assets under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).  

The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) had issued an order allowing SBI to take possession of the property, but the petitioners contended that the order was executed after the stipulated time, making it illegal.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. Whether the writ petition should be entertained given the availability of alternative remedies.  
2. Whether the time limit under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act is mandatory or directory.  
3. Whether possession could be taken after the expiration of the time specified in the warrant.  

**Arguments:**  
- **For the Petitioners:**  
  - The execution of the order by the Advocate Commissioner was beyond the 60-day limit set by the CMM, rendering it illegal.  
  - The CMM's order should have been adhered to strictly, and without an extension, the warrant lost its validity.  
- **For the Respondents (SBI):**  
  - The time limit was directory, not mandatory, and the delay in execution was due to the petitioners' actions, including filing multiple cases.  
  - The Advocate Commissioners were not made parties to the petition, which was a procedural flaw.  

**Judgment:**  
1. The court held that the writ petition was maintainable despite the availability of alternative remedies, as the issues raised were significant and warranted judicial review.  
2. The court concluded that the time limit under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act is directory, meaning that while it should be adhered to, failure to comply does not invalidate the actions taken under the Act.  
3. However, the court ruled that once the time specified in the warrant had elapsed, possession could not be taken under that warrant.  
4. The court declared the action of the Advocate Commissioner in taking possession on 17 December 2021 as illegal, as it was executed beyond the time limit set by the CMM.  
5. The court restored the status quo as of 16 December 2021 and directed SBI to approach the CMM for an extension of time to take possession of the secured asset.  
6. The court emphasized the need for CMMs to set reasonable time limits for executing such orders in the future.  

**Conclusion:**  
The writ petition was disposed of in favor of the petitioners, with directions for restoring the status quo and allowing SBI to seek a new order for possession in accordance with the law.",HIGH COURT OF ANDHRA PRADESH,"['M/s.

The applicants were accused of selling 'fruit beer' in a public place on November 21, 2021, and some of the products were reportedly sold after their expiry date. The complaint was lodged by Police Naik Pramod Gaikwad, leading to the seizure of the fruit beer and subsequent analysis by a Food Analyst.

The prosecution presented a report from the Food Analyst, dated December 10, 2021, indicating that the fruit beer did not meet the standards set by the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and was deemed unsafe for human consumption. The applicants' counsel argued that the charges under Section 328 of the IPC were not substantiated and that custodial interrogation was unnecessary. However, the court noted that no precedent was provided by the applicants' counsel to support their claim for bail in similar circumstances.

Judge C.V. Bhadang emphasized the seriousness of the allegations, particularly given the health implications for the public. The court concluded that the nature of the offense warranted further investigation into the source and sale of the products, which could necessitate custodial interrogation.

Irshad Ansari, sought anticipatory bail in connection with Bagodar P.S. Case No.172 of 2021. The case involved allegations under sections 272 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code, as well as Section 48 and 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The hearing took place on January 21, 2022, before Hon'ble Mr. Justice Anil Kumar Choudhary, with Mr. Prabhat Kr. Sinha representing the petitioner and Mr. P.D. Agrawal serving as the Special Public Prosecutor for the State.

During the proceedings, the learned counsel for the petitioner indicated a willingness to rectify certain defects noted by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the court resumed physical operations. The court accepted this undertaking and chose to overlook the defects for the time being.

The Special Public Prosecutor argued that all the offences cited in the case were bailable, particularly emphasizing that the only charge against the petitioner under Section 59(i) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, carried a maximum penalty of six months. Consequently, he contended that the anticipatory bail application was not maintainable.

The petitioner's counsel did not contest this assertion regarding the bailable nature of the offences. After considering the facts and the submissions made, the court concluded that the anticipatory bail application was dismissed on the grounds of non-maintainability, as the petitioner failed to demonstrate any apprehension of arrest concerning a non-bailable offence.

92,Md_Mahbub_Alam_vs_The_State_Of_Assam_on_6_January_2022.PDF,"In the case of Md. Mahbub Alam vs The State of Assam, heard on January 6, 2022, the petitioner, Md. Mahbub Alam, sought to quash an order dated December 24, 2021, issued by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate in Karimganj. This order was related to Bazaricherra Police Station Case No. 214/2021, under Sections 418 and 411 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The case arose when police discovered 91 bags of suspected Burmese dried Areca betel nut at the petitioner’s residence during a routine check. The police seized the betel nuts after the petitioner failed to provide satisfactory documentation regarding their possession.

Initially, the court granted the petitioner zimma (custody) of the seized betel nuts on November 15, 2021, with conditions that he would not sell them until the investigation was complete and would produce them as required. However, on December 24, 2021, based on a report from the Food Safety Officer indicating that the betel nuts were unfit for human consumption, the court ordered their destruction without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

The petitioner challenged this order, arguing that it was illegal as it was made without his knowledge or opportunity to contest the destruction of the seized items. He cited Section 38(4) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, which mandates that the owner of food articles must be notified before any destruction occurs. The petitioner contended that the court's decision was made solely on the basis of the I.O.'s report without his input, thus violating his rights.

The court, presided over by Justice Rumi Kumari Phukan, acknowledged that the petitioner had not been given a chance to present his case before the order for destruction was made. The judge emphasized the importance of adhering to the provisions of the Food Safety Act and the necessity of hearing the petitioner before making such a significant decision regarding the seized property.

Consequently, the court quashed the impugned order dated December 24, 2021, and directed the trial court to provide the petitioner with an opportunity to be heard before making any further decisions regarding the seized betel nuts. The petitioner was instructed to appear before the trial court within 15 days, and the trial court was ordered to pass an appropriate order in accordance with the law after hearing both parties.",Gauhati High Court,['Md.

**Date of Judgment:** 25 February 2022  

**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioner:** Messrs Jet Gateway Express Shipping (a partnership firm)  
- **Respondents:** Union of India, represented by Mundra Customs Commissionerate and other officials  

**Background:**  
The petitioner, a partnership firm based in Dubai, was involved in the export of goods, including whey protein and dietary supplements. The goods were shipped to India but were seized by the customs authorities at Mundra Port due to alleged mis-declaration and non-compliance with customs regulations. The petitioner sought to challenge the absolute confiscation of their goods, arguing that the goods were not prohibited and that they should be given the option to pay a fine instead of facing confiscation.

**Key Points of the Judgment:**  
1. **Confiscation Order:** The customs authorities had ordered the absolute confiscation of 16,614 packages of whey protein and dietary supplements, along with 464 cartons of wooden laminated flooring, claiming mis-declaration and an attempt to evade customs duties.
2. **Petitioner's Argument:** The petitioner contended that the goods were not prohibited and that the confiscation was without jurisdiction. They argued that they should be allowed to pay a fine in lieu of confiscation as per Section 125 of the Customs Act, 1962.
3. **Investigation Findings:** The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) conducted an investigation and found that the goods were mis-declared. However, laboratory tests confirmed that the whey protein and dietary supplements conformed to safety standards and were not hazardous.
4. **Legal Provisions:** The court examined Section 125 of the Customs Act, which allows for the option to pay a fine in lieu of confiscation for goods that are not prohibited. The court noted that the goods in question did not fall under the category of prohibited items.
5. **Court's Decision:** The court ruled in favor of the petitioner, stating that the absolute confiscation was not justified. The court directed the customs authorities to allow the petitioner to pay an appropriate fine and other duties in lieu of confiscation. The court emphasized that the petitioner should be given the opportunity to re-export the goods after payment of the fine.
6. **Implementation:** The court ordered that the calculation of the fine and duties be provided to the petitioner within a week, and upon payment, the goods should be released within a week thereafter.

**Conclusion:** The High Court of Gujarat allowed the petition, emphasizing the need for adherence to statutory provisions regarding confiscation and the rights of the owner to pay a fine instead of facing absolute confiscation.

Sayani vs The State Of Maharashtra, the Supreme Court of India, presided over by Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka, heard a petition for special leave to appeal on January 7, 2022. The petitioner, Mohd. Salim Pir Mohd. Sayani, challenged a decision made by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, which was delivered on December 20, 2021, in CRLA(ABA) No. 817/2021.

The petitioner was facing charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, specifically related to FIR No. 398/2021, registered on November 14, 2021, at Police Station Ner Parsopant, District Yavatmal. The charges included violations of Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 272 (adulteration of food or drink), 273 (sale of noxious food or drink), and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), along with several provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act.

During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Rohit Anil Rathi and Mr. Shyam Mohta, argued that the issues raised in this petition had already been considered by a coordinate bench in a previous special leave petition (SLP(Crl.) No. 3602/2021), which had granted interim protection to the petitioners on May 7, 2021.

The Supreme Court, after hearing the arguments, issued a notice returnable in four weeks and allowed for dasti service (direct service) of the notice. Importantly, the court provided interim relief by stating that the petitioner shall not be arrested in connection with the aforementioned FIR until further orders. The court also directed the petitioner to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.

Sathish Kumar, addressed a criminal original petition filed by Mondelez India Foods Pvt. Ltd. and its Senior Manager, Arlette Noronha, seeking to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.3867 of 2017. The complaint against the petitioners was based on allegations of selling contaminated chocolate, specifically a Cadbury Temptation product that was found to contain dead worms, which was deemed unsafe under the Food Safety & Standards Act.

The complaint originated when a consumer, R. Santosh Kumar, received the wrong product and later discovered worms in the chocolate after refrigerating it. Following this, a sample was taken by the Food Safety Officer, A. Elangovan, and sent for analysis, which confirmed the presence of dead worms. The petitioners contended that the sampling process did not comply with the mandatory provisions of the Food Safety & Standards Act, particularly that the sample was not divided into four parts as required, and that the analysis report was not communicated to the manufacturer.

The court noted several key points:
1. The sample was not divided into four parts as mandated, which deprived the manufacturer of the opportunity to have the sample tested independently.
2. There was a significant delay in the prosecution process, with the sanction for prosecution being sought almost a year after the analysis report was received, which violated the statutory timelines set forth in the Act.
3. The Food Safety Officer failed to send the analysis report to the manufacturer, which is a critical procedural requirement.
4. The reasons provided for the delay in seeking prosecution were deemed insufficient and did not meet the legal requirements for extending the prosecution period beyond one year.

Given these violations of mandatory provisions and the denial of the petitioners' rights, the court concluded that the prosecution could not be maintained.

96,Monu_Thakur_vs_State_Of_U_P_on_4_March_2022.PDF,"**Case Summary: Monu Thakur vs State of U.P. (4 March 2022)**

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Allahabad  
**Judges:** Hon'ble Manoj Misra, Hon'ble Sameer Jain  
**Case Number:** Capital Cases No. 13 of 2021, Reference No. 10 of 2021  
**Appellant:** Monu Thakur  
**Respondent:** State of U.P.  

**Background:**  
Monu Thakur was convicted by the Additional District and Sessions Judge in Hathras for multiple serious offenses, including murder (Section 302 IPC), rape (Section 376 IPC), and various offenses under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The trial court sentenced him to death and imposed fines for the various charges. The case arose from an incident on April 15, 2019, where a 14-year-old girl was allegedly set on fire after resisting the accused's advances. The victim succumbed to her injuries on May 1, 2019.

**Prosecution Case:**  
The prosecution's case was based on a written report filed by the victim's father, who was not an eyewitness. The victim's maternal grandmother (PW-2) and another witness (PW-3) testified that the victim caught fire accidentally while cooking, contradicting the prosecution's claim that the accused set her ablaze. Medical reports indicated severe burns and a torn hymen, suggesting possible sexual assault. However, the prosecution's evidence was largely circumstantial and relied heavily on the victim's alleged dying declaration, which was not properly substantiated in court.

**Trial Court Findings:**  
The trial court found the victim to be a minor and accepted the FIR and medical evidence as sufficient to establish the charges against Monu Thakur. It relied on the presumption of guilt under Section 29 of the POCSO Act, which shifts the burden of proof to the accused once foundational facts are established.

**Arguments on Appeal:**  
The defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove the foundational facts necessary to invoke the presumption under the POCSO Act. They contended that the testimonies of key witnesses (PW-2 and PW-3) supported the defense's claim of accidental burning rather than intentional harm by the accused. Furthermore, the alleged dying declaration was neither exhibited nor properly authenticated, rendering it inadmissible.

**State's Position:**  
The prosecution maintained that the evidence, including the medical reports and the FIR, established the charges against the accused. They argued that the witnesses' recantation was due to external pressures and that the presumption of guilt under the POCSO Act was rightly applied.

**Judgment:**  
The High Court found that the prosecution had not established the foundational facts necessary to invoke the presumption of guilt under Section 29 of the POCSO Act. The testimonies of the witnesses did not support the prosecution's narrative of intentional harm by the accused. The court noted that the alleged dying declaration was not properly proved and could not be relied upon for conviction. Consequently, the court set aside the trial court's judgment, acquitted Monu Thakur of all charges, and rejected the reference for confirmation of the death penalty. The appellant was ordered to be released unless wanted in any other case.

**Conclusion:**  
The appeal was allowed, and the conviction was overturned due to insufficient evidence and procedural irregularities in the trial.",HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD,['Monu Thakur'],['State of U.P.'],"['Manoj Misra', 'Sameer Jain']",04-03-2022,[],"['Hathras', 'Aligarh', 'U.P.']","['Section 302 of IPC', 'Section 376 of IPC', 'Section 326-A of IPC', 'Section 354 of IPC', 'Section 354-A of IPC', 'Section 452 of IPC', 'Section 7 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012', 'Section 8 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012', 'Section 5 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012', 'Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012']","['Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012', 'Indian Penal Code']",[],"Monu Thakur was convicted for multiple serious offenses including murder and sexual assault against a minor, resulting in a death sentence.

Chattopadhyay, heard the case WP(C)(PIL) No.04/2021 involving Mrs. S. Deb (Gupta) as the petitioner against Mr. Debalay Bhattacharjee and others as respondents. The case centered around allegations that packaged drinking water sold in Tripura did not meet the standards set by the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

During the proceedings, the court noted the existence of the 'All Tripura Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturer Association,' which had submitted a letter to the Chief Secretary of Tripura. The court observed that no individual producers or manufacturers had been named as respondents in the case, which was necessary for a comprehensive resolution. Consequently, the court ordered the impleadment of the All Tripura Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturer Association as respondent no.5 and the Public Works Department (Drinking Water & Sanitation) of the Government of Tripura as respondent no.6.

The court directed that notices be issued to these newly added respondents, with a returnable period of four weeks. The Government Advocate accepted notice on behalf of the Public Works Department and was instructed to file an affidavit regarding the existence of testing laboratories or mechanisms for checking the quality of packaged drinking water in Tripura.

Additionally, the court mandated that the petitioner publish a notice in local newspapers, both in English and vernacular languages, to inform the public about the PIL and invite participation from any affected parties. This notice was to be published within two weeks.

The court also decided to add the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) as respondent no.7, directing that they be notified and required to explain why their order dated March 26, 2021, regarding the necessity of a BIS license for manufacturers of packaged drinking water had not been enforced by other authorities, including BIS.

Furthermore, the court instructed the State to inspect all packaged drinking water producers to verify their compliance with the licensing and registration requirements under the FSS Act, 2006.

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Patna  
**Date:** 9 February 2022  
**Judge:** Ashutosh Kumar  
**Case Number:** Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 280 of 2021  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioner:** Mukesh Kumar, a distributor of food products in Madhubani, Bihar.  
- **Respondents:** The State of Bihar through the Director General of Police, Superintendent of Police, Madhubani, and the Station House Officer, Pandaul.  

**Background:**  
The petitioner, Mukesh Kumar, sought to quash the prosecution initiated against him under various sections of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The case stemmed from a complaint filed by Jitendra Kumar Singh, an Additional Station House Officer, alleging that Mukesh Kumar was selling non-alcoholic beverages that contained alcohol above permissible limits. The beverages in question included Kingfisher Ultra, Heineken, and Warrior Strawberry, which were seized and tested, revealing a small percentage of ethyl alcohol.  

**Arguments Presented:**  
1. **Petitioner's Defense:**  
   - Mukesh Kumar argued that he lawfully purchased the beverages and held a license under the Food Safety Act.  
   - He contended that the presence of alcohol in beverages can occur naturally due to various factors, including climate and storage conditions.  
   - He cited precedents from other cases, including the Adolph Coors Company case, which highlighted the challenges in measuring alcohol content accurately due to environmental factors.  
   - The petitioner emphasized that the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act should incorporate a tolerance limit for alcohol content, similar to the FSSAI regulations, to avoid wrongful prosecution based on minor discrepancies.  
   - He argued that the prosecution lacked a clear protocol for testing, which could lead to erroneous results and unjust harassment.  

2. **State's Position:**  
   - The State, represented by Mr. P.K. Verma, argued for the validity of the prosecution based on the test results indicating alcohol content exceeding legal limits.  

**Judgment:**  
The High Court, after considering the arguments, ruled in favor of the petitioner. The court found that:  
- The minor excess of alcohol content did not constitute a violation of the Prohibition Act, as the beverages were not sold as intoxicants.  
- The court noted the inherent margin of error in testing and the conflicting test results, which warranted giving the benefit of doubt to the petitioner.  
- The court emphasized that the purpose of the Prohibition Act is to enforce complete prohibition of liquor, and a minor infraction in alcohol content does not align with the intent of the law.  
- The court quashed the FIR and the order of cognizance against Mukesh Kumar, stating that the facts did not warrant prosecution.  

**Conclusion:**  
The High Court quashed the FIR (Pandaul P.S. Case No. 270 of 2020) and all related prosecutions against Mukesh Kumar, allowing his application and I.A. No. 1 of 2021. The judgment underscored the need for reasonable standards and tolerance limits in food safety regulations to prevent undue harassment of individuals.",Patna High Court,['Mukesh Kumar'],"['The State Of Bihar Through The Director General Of Police, Bihar, Patna', 'The Superintendent Of Police, District - Madhubani', 'The Station-House-Officer, Pandaul, P.S.

99,M_Kaja_Mohindeen_vs_State_Rep_By_on_9_February_2022.PDF,"In the case of M.Kaja Mohindeen vs State Rep By, the petitioner, M.Kaja Mohindeen, sought to quash the complaint in C.C.No.131 of 2017 pending before the Judicial Magistrate in Ambattur, Chennai. The complaint was filed by N.Karmegam, the Food Safety Officer, against Mohindeen and others, alleging violations under the Food Safety and Standardization Act, 2006, concerning a health drink produced by Southern Health Foods Pvt Ltd. The complaint arose after samples of the health drink were found to be sub-standard, unsafe, and misbranded, with the analysis report dated June 10, 2014.

The petitioner’s counsel argued that the complaint was flawed because it did not include Southern Health Foods Pvt Ltd as a party, despite the company being the manufacturer of the product in question. According to Section 66 of the Food Safety and Standardization Act, if an offense is committed by a company, the company must be included as an accused. The petitioner, being a nominee of the company, contended that the absence of the company in the complaint rendered the proceedings against him invalid. The counsel also referenced a previous case where similar proceedings were quashed due to the non-impleading of the company.

The Additional Public Prosecutor acknowledged that the company was not added as an accused, which is a requirement under the law. Upon reviewing the records, the court noted that there were no allegations against the petitioner indicating he was responsible for the company's business conduct. Consequently, the court found that the prosecution against the petitioner could not be sustained and that continuing the proceedings would constitute an abuse of legal process.

Ultimately, the High Court, presided over by Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira, allowed the Criminal Original Petition, quashing the proceedings against M.Kaja Mohindeen in C.C.No.131 of 2017.

The accident occurred when the petitioner was riding his motorcycle near Someshwara hotel in Dobbaspet, and a KSRTC bus allegedly collided with him due to the bus driver's rash and negligent driving. The petitioner suffered multiple severe injuries, underwent extensive medical treatment, and claimed permanent disability affecting his ability to earn a livelihood.

**Petitioner's Claims:**  
- The petitioner detailed the nature of his injuries, including fractures and head trauma, and the extensive medical treatment he received, which cost over Rs. 18 lakhs.  
- He claimed that due to the accident, he suffered permanent disability and loss of earnings, thus justifying his claim for compensation.

- The KSRTC denied liability, asserting that the bus was being driven cautiously and that the accident was caused by the petitioner's negligence, as he was allegedly using a mobile phone while riding without a helmet.

- **Issue No. 1:** The tribunal found in favor of the petitioner, establishing that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the KSRTC bus driver, supported by police documents and witness testimonies.  
- **Issue No. 2:** The tribunal acknowledged the petitioner's injuries and the impact on his earning capacity. However, it noted the lack of concrete evidence regarding the petitioner's income prior to the accident, leading to the use of notional income for compensation calculations.  
- **Issue No. 3:** The tribunal determined the compensation amount based on the evidence presented, including medical expenses, loss of income, and pain and suffering.

**Compensation Awarded:**  
The tribunal awarded a total compensation of Rs. 17,33,800, broken down as follows:

**Interest:**

**Final Order:**  
The claim petition was partly allowed, with the respondent directed to deposit the compensation amount within two months. Upon deposit, 75% of the amount would be released to the petitioner’s wife, and the remaining 25% would be kept in a fixed deposit for three years.

**Court:** LXXXIX Addl. City Civil & Sessions Judge, Bengaluru  
**Date of Judgment:** 3rd January 2022  
**Case Number:** Com.A.P.No.05/2021  
**Plaintiff:** M/s. BEML Limited  
**Defendants:** 1. M/s Veer Engineering Works  
2. Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) Veeranna G. Tigadi  

**Background:**  
The plaintiff, M/s. BEML Limited, filed a suit under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking to set aside an arbitration award dated 11.08.2020 and a modified award dated 17.10.2020 issued by the sole arbitrator, Mr. Justice (Retd.) Veeranna G. Tigadi, in arbitration case A.C.No.01/2019. The arbitration arose from a maintenance and repair contract between the parties concerning heavy equipment used in mining operations.  

**Claimant's Case:**  
The claimant, M/s. Veer Engineering Works, argued that they had been in a long-standing business relationship with the respondent (BEML) and had entered into a Maintenance and Repair Contract (MARC) for various heavy equipment. They claimed that due to a significant increase in minimum wages mandated by the government, they incurred substantial losses and sought reimbursement for wage differences and other related expenses. The claimant presented several claims, including:  
1. **Claim 1:** An amount of €15,24,186 for wage differences quantified by the Regional Labor Commissioner.  
2. **Claim 2:** An amount of €50,77,062 for increased rates due to unprecedented variables during the execution of the MARC.  
3. **Claim 3:** Approximately €10,00,000 for expenses incurred in the arbitration proceedings.  
4. **Interest:** At 18% per annum on all claims.  

**Respondent's Defense:**  
The respondent, M/s. BEML Limited, contended that the claims were baseless and that the claimant was solely responsible for paying the minimum wages as per the contract. They argued that the claimant had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims and that the arbitration tribunal had no jurisdiction to award compensation for wage differences since the contract did not provide for such adjustments. The respondent also highlighted that the principal employer, SAIL, had refused to amend the work order to accommodate wage increases.  

**Arbitral Tribunal's Findings:**  
The tribunal found in favor of the claimant, awarding them:  
1. €15,05,010 for wage differences from January to May 2017.  
2. €21,47,165 for wage differences from June to December 2017.  
3. €4,45,600 for expenses incurred in the arbitration proceedings.  
The tribunal awarded interest at 9% per annum instead of the claimed 18%.  

**Judgment:**  
The court dismissed the plaintiff's application to set aside the arbitration award, confirming the tribunal's findings. The court ruled that the claimant had established their claims based on the evidence presented and that the tribunal had acted within its jurisdiction. The court emphasized that it could not interfere with the arbitrator's findings unless they were patently illegal or against public policy, which was not the case here.  

**Conclusion:**  
The court upheld the arbitration award, confirming the amounts awarded to the claimant and dismissing the plaintiff's claims with costs.","LXXXIX Addl.City Civil & Sessions Judge, Bengaluru",['M/s.BEML Limited'],"['M/s Veer Engineering Works', ""Hon'ble Mr.Justice (Retd.)

**Judgment Date:** 22 February 2022  
**Court:** High Court for the State of Telangana, Hyderabad  
**Judge:** Dr. Justice Chillakur Sumalatha  
**Criminal Petition No.:** 14914 of 2013  
**Key Parties:**  
- **Petitioner:** M/s Hindustan Unilever Limited, represented by Executive Director Mr. Pradeep Banerjee  
- **Respondents:** The State of Andhra Pradesh through Public Prosecutor and others  

**Background:**  
The petitioner, M/s Hindustan Unilever Limited, sought to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.7 of 2013 pending before the VI Additional Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Warangal. The case arose from an inspection conducted on 29 March 2012 by the District Inspector of Legal Metrology, which found violations related to the packaging of ""Modern Milk Classic Milk Bread"". The inspector noted that the manufacturer failed to declare the month and year of packaging on the product, leading to the seizure of the products and subsequent legal action.  

**Key Arguments:**  
1. **Applicability of Legal Metrology Act:** The petitioner argued that the provisions of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, and the Packaged Commodities Rules, 2011, were not applicable to the case. They contended that the relevant legislation for food products is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which should have governed the matter.  
2. **Violation of Natural Justice:** The petitioner claimed that their right to a fair hearing was violated when the appeal against the initial notice was dismissed without a hearing. They argued that the Controller of Legal Metrology failed to provide an opportunity to present their case, which is a breach of the principles of natural justice.  
3. **Cognizance by Magistrate:** The petitioner contended that the Magistrate took cognizance of the complaint without properly applying his mind to the facts and the applicable law, which is a procedural error.  

**Court's Findings:**  
1. **Legal Framework:** The court examined the provisions of the Legal Metrology Act and the Packaged Commodities Rules, concluding that the specific provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act were applicable to the food products in question. The court noted that the Department of Legal Metrology should have dropped the proceedings based on this understanding.  
2. **Natural Justice:** The court found that the petitioner was not given a fair opportunity to be heard regarding their appeal, which constituted a violation of natural justice principles. The court emphasized that procedural fairness is essential in administrative actions.  
3. **Cognizance of Offence:** The court ruled that the Magistrate's decision to take cognizance was made without proper consideration of the applicable laws and facts, which rendered the proceedings unjustifiable.  

**Final Decision:**  
The High Court allowed the criminal petition and quashed the proceedings against M/s Hindustan Unilever Limited in C.C.No.7 of 2013. The interim order previously granted was vacated, and any pending miscellaneous petitions were closed.

**Court:** High Court of Karnataka, Kalaburagi Bench  
**Judge:** Hon'ble Mr. Justice V. Srishananda  
**Writ Petition No.:** 59039/2015 (GM)  
**Petitioner:** Sri Iqbal Syed Sab Dafedhar, Proprietor of M/S Dafedhar Distributors  
**Respondents:** 1. Food Safety Inspector, Department of Food Safety and Standards, Vijayapura  
2. Designated Officer, Department of Food Safety and Standards, Vijayapura  

**Background:**  
The petitioner, M/S Dafedhar Distributors, is a wholesale distributor of various food products, including ""Sunfeast Yippee! Noodles"" manufactured by ITC Limited. On June 11, 2015, a sample of the noodles was collected by the Food Safety Inspector for testing. The Food Analyst's report indicated that while the sample conformed to safety standards, it was misbranded due to the absence of testing for Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), which was not available in local laboratories. The report suggested that the product was misbranded despite the label stating ""no added MSG.""

**Key Arguments:**  
1. **Misbranding Claim:** The petitioner argued that the product could not be deemed misbranded as the label explicitly stated there was no added MSG, and the Food Analyst's report acknowledged the lack of testing facilities for MSG.
2. **Lack of Laboratory Facilities:** The petitioner highlighted that there were no laboratories in Karnataka capable of testing for MSG, making the misbranding claim baseless.
3. **Procedural Irregularities:** The petitioner contended that the Additional District Magistrate's order to initiate prosecution was flawed as it did not allow for an appeal against the Food Analyst's report, violating the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.
4. **Legal Precedents:** The petitioner referenced a previous judgment where similar circumstances led to the quashing of proceedings due to the absence of proper testing facilities for MSG.

**Respondent's Position:**  
The respondents maintained that the Food Analyst's report justified the misbranding claim and that the petitioner was given an opportunity to have the sample retested at a referral laboratory.

**Court's Findings:**  
1. The court noted that the Food Analyst's report did not provide conclusive evidence of misbranding since it could not test for MSG and acknowledged the label's claim of no added MSG.
2. The court emphasized the importance of proper laboratory facilities for food safety testing and the need for adherence to procedural fairness in adjudication processes.
3. The court found that the prosecution initiated against the petitioner was unjustified and lacked a proper basis, given the circumstances.

**Final Decision:**  
The High Court allowed the writ petition, quashing the criminal proceedings initiated against the petitioner in CC No. 307/037/225/2015-16. The court ordered the refund of any deposits made by the petitioner and issued guidelines for the effective implementation of the Food Safety and Standards Act, including the establishment of proper laboratories and the appointment of Food Safety Officers in every Taluk.

**Guidelines Issued:**  
- Establishment of proper laboratories in consultation with NABL.  
- Appointment of Food Safety Officers in each Taluk.  
- Training for Food Safety Officers on sample collection and preservation.

**Counsel for Respondent:** Mr. H. A. Siddiqui, Sr. AAG  

**Background:**  
The petitioners sought to quash a complaint against them pending in the court of the Sub Judge (Special Municipal Magistrate) Jammu, which was filed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. The complaint stemmed from a drug sample taken from the Government Hospital Gandhi Nagar, which was found to be of substandard quality. The petitioners argued that there were no allegations against them that would constitute an offense under the Act, and that the main accused (the Medical Officer who sold the drugs) was not included in the complaint. They also claimed that the prolonged proceedings had caused them significant distress.  

**Key Arguments:**  
1. **Lack of Allegations:** The petitioners contended that the complaint did not contain any allegations that could suggest their involvement in an offense under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.  
2. **Violation of Section 34(2):** They argued that since the main accused was not included in the complaint, the proceedings against them were invalid.  
3. **Representation Issues:** The petitioners claimed that they were not properly represented in the case, as the partnership firm was not adequately served.  
4. **Delay in Proceedings:** They highlighted that the case had been pending for over 12 years, causing them mental and financial strain.  

**Respondent's Counterarguments:**  
The respondent maintained that the provisions of Section 34 of the Act were applicable and that the absence of the main accused did not invalidate the proceedings against the petitioners. They argued that the delay alone was not sufficient grounds for quashing the complaint.  

**Court's Findings:**  
- The court found that the drugs supplied by the petitioners were indeed linked to the complaint.  
- It ruled that Section 34(2) of the Act did not apply as the necessary parties were not included in the complaint.  
- The court noted that the representation of the petitioners was adequate, as one of the partners had been appearing in court.  
- While acknowledging the delay in proceedings, the court emphasized the seriousness of the allegations related to public health and safety.  

**Final Decision:**  
The court did not quash the proceedings but directed the trial court to conclude the trial within six months. It also mandated that the prosecution ensure the service of the accused who had not yet been served. The court emphasized that if the prosecution failed to serve the accused, the trial court could proceed according to the law.

The petition was disposed of with directions for expeditious trial, reflecting the court's concern for public health and the need for timely justice.",HIGH COURT OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND LADAKH AT JAMMU,['M/s Narain Dass Bhagwan Dass'],['State of J&K'],['RAJNESH OSWAL'],31-01-2022,"['M/S Associated Pharma', 'Government Hospital Gandhi Nagar', 'M/s.

However, the authorities issued an NOC for only one product, rejecting the other two based on regulatory violations concerning labeling and certification.

**Key Issues:**  
1. The rejection of NOC for two products was primarily due to the labeling that indicated the products were suitable for infants (indicated by ""6+ months"") without the necessary Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification.
2. The authorities noted that the products were labeled as organic, but there was no bilateral agreement between India and Italy for mutual recognition of organic certification.
3. The petitioner argued that the products complied with the Food Safety and Standards (Organic Foods) Regulations, 2017, and did not require BIS certification.

**Court Proceedings:**  
- The petitioner appealed against the rejection of the NOC, which was upheld by the Director (Import) in New Delhi. A review application was also filed, which led to a decision allowing the products to be sampled and tested as conventional food, provided the organic labeling was removed.
- The petitioner contended that the products were certified organic by ICEA, Italy, and that the absence of a bilateral agreement should not preclude their import.
- The respondents maintained that the lack of a bilateral agreement necessitated re-certification of the organic products and that the labeling issues were valid grounds for rejection.

**Judgment:**  
The High Court upheld the decisions of the respondent authorities, stating:
1. The products imported by the petitioner were indeed standardized food products as per the relevant regulations.
2. There was no existing bilateral agreement between India and Italy for mutual recognition of organic certification, thus the products required re-certification.
3. The court noted that the respondent authorities had provided a one-time relaxation for the petitioner to rectify the labeling issues and comply with the regulations for future imports.
4. The court found no grounds to interfere with the orders of the respondent authorities and dismissed the writ application.

**Conclusion:**  
The court ruled in favor of the Union of India, affirming the rejection of the NOC for the two products and allowing the petitioner to rectify the labeling as per the authorities' directives. The case was disposed of without granting the relief sought by the petitioner.",HIGH COURT OF GUJARAT AT AHMEDABAD,"['M/S Nutripure Fods Private Limited', 'Dharmesh Gordhandas Ratanghayra']",['Union Of India'],['Vaibhavi D.

Ltd. vs. The Assistant Commissioner of Customs, the petitioner, represented by its Director Mr. M.R. Suresh, filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking to quash an order dated 05.08.2020 from the respondent, the Assistant Commissioner of Customs, and to obtain a Detention Certificate to waive detention and demurrage charges incurred during the period from 15.05.2020 to 25.05.2020.

The petitioner had imported a consignment of Bamboo Sticks and filed a Bill of Entry on 24.04.2020. The import required a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Plant Protection, Quarantine and Storage Department, which was issued on 14.05.2020 but was not uploaded in the ICEGATE system until 29.05.2020. This delay led to the imposition of detention charges by the shipping line and the Container Freight Station, which the petitioner argued were not their fault.

The petitioner contended that the Customs Department's failure to upload the NOC in a timely manner caused the delays and that they had communicated with the ICEGATE help desk multiple times, receiving assurances that the issue was resolved, which it was not. The petitioner sought a Detention Certificate to claim refunds for the charges incurred due to the delay.

In contrast, the respondent argued that the delay was due to the petitioner’s failure to ensure the NOC was uploaded properly and that the petitioner did not follow the necessary procedures for electronic filing as mandated by the Bill of Entry (Electronic Integrated Declaration and Paperless Processing) Regulations, 2018. The respondent maintained that the Customs Department had a critical role in enforcing import regulations and that the petitioner was at fault for not obtaining the NOC in a timely manner.

The court examined the arguments and noted that the delay in uploading the NOC was not attributable to the petitioner. It highlighted that the Customs Department had transitioned to an online system for processing Bills of Entry, and any technical glitches should not penalize the importer. The court referenced previous clarifications from the Central Board of Excise and Customs regarding the issuance of Detention Certificates, emphasizing that an importer should not be held liable for delays caused by technical issues beyond their control.

Ultimately, the High Court of Judicature at Madras ruled in favor of the petitioner, quashing the impugned order and directing the respondent to issue the Detention Certificate within 30 days. The court concluded that the petitioner should not bear the financial burden of the delays caused by the Customs Department's technical issues.",High Court of Judicature at Madras,['M/s.Rangsugandh Manufacturing Pvt.

Raja, sought to quash a private complaint filed against them under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The complaint stemmed from an inspection conducted on August 22, 2015, where the Food Safety Officer seized four packets of Cool Lip Filter Tobbaq, which were later found to contain nicotine, deemed unsafe for consumption. The prosecution was initiated after identifying the petitioner as the manufacturer of the product.

The petitioner contended that they were only the manufacturer and had no involvement in the sale of the product in Tamil Nadu, as their operations were limited to Haryana. They argued that the prosecution was baseless, asserting that tobacco products do not fall under the category of food products unless mixed with food. The petitioner emphasized that they had obtained the necessary permissions for manufacturing and that the referral lab report confirmed the product was a tobacco item, not a food product.

The Government Advocate countered that the presence of nicotine in the product warranted prosecution, as the petitioner admitted to being the manufacturer. However, the court noted that the prosecution lacked evidence linking the petitioner to the sale of the product in Tamil Nadu. The court highlighted that the mere presence of the product in Tamil Nadu did not imply that the manufacturer was responsible for its sale, especially since the manufacturing of such products was permitted in other states.

Ultimately, the court found that the prosecution against the petitioner was unwarranted and a waste of judicial resources, leading to the decision to quash the complaint.

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Madras  
**Date:** 21 January 2022  
**Judgment by:** Justice M. Dhandapani  
**W.P.No.:** 14348 of 2021  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioner:** M/s.Uniqeline, represented by its Proprietor Mr. A. Prabhakaran  
- **Respondent:** The Authorized Officer, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)  

**Background:**  
M/s.Uniqeline, a proprietorship concern, holds a Custom House Agent (CHA) license issued by the Commissioner of Customs, Chennai, valid until 2030. The petitioner sought a Writ of Mandamus to lift an alert/comment posted on the FSSAI online portal on 09 April 2021, which stated that no applications submitted by M/s.Uniqeline for FSSAI clearance would be processed until an investigation regarding customs clearance for a rejected product was completed. This comment severely impacted the business operations of M/s.Uniqeline.  

**Petitioner's Argument:**  
The petitioner argued that the FSSAI had not provided any evidence of wrongdoing or malafide intent against them when the comment was posted. They claimed that the comment effectively paralyzed their business activities. The petitioner made representations to higher authorities within FSSAI, but received no response, prompting the filing of the writ petition.  

**Developments During Proceedings:**  
During the pendency of the writ petition, the comment on the FSSAI portal was removed. The petitioner also indicated that they had made five applications in December 2021, all of which were processed, allowing them to operate the bill of entry on behalf of importers.  

**Court's Decision:**  
The court acknowledged the removal of the comment and the subsequent processing of the petitioner’s applications. Given these developments, the court concluded that there was no longer any matter requiring adjudication. Therefore, the writ petition was closed, and no costs were imposed. The connected miscellaneous petition was also closed.

**Date:** 19 January 2022  
**Judges:** Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili  
**Case Numbers:** Writ Petition (PIL) No. 176 of 2020, Writ Petition Nos. 3272 and 3719 of 2021  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Nalin Venkat Kishore Kumar and another petitioner challenging the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India's (FSSAI) directive allowing the use of Ethephon for artificially ripening fruits. The petitioners argue that Ethephon is a hazardous insecticide that poses health risks, citing its corrosive properties and potential to cause burns and other health issues. They contend that its use violates the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the Insecticides Act, 1968, which prohibit the use of insecticides on food items.  

**Key Arguments:**  
1. **Petitioners' Claims:**  
   - Ethephon is classified as an insecticide and is hazardous.  
   - Its use for ripening fruits is unsafe and violates food safety regulations.  
   - The FSSAI's directive is ultra vires (beyond its powers) as it contradicts existing laws.  

2. **Interveners' Defense:**  
   - Interveners, including importers and manufacturers of Ethephon, argue that Ethephon is not sprayed directly on fruits but is used in sachets to generate Ethylene gas, which is safe for ripening.  
   - They highlight that the FSSAI has conducted scientific studies and approved Ethephon's use under specific guidelines to prevent the illegal use of more dangerous substances like carbide gas.  
   - The FSSAI's guidelines ensure that Ethephon sachets do not come into direct contact with fruits, mitigating health risks.  

3. **FSSAI's Position:**  
   - The FSSAI asserts that its regulations are based on expert opinions and scientific research.  
   - Ethephon is used as a plant growth regulator and is essential for safe fruit ripening, especially after banning more harmful substances.  
   - The FSSAI maintains that its guidelines comply with the Food Safety and Standards Act and the Insecticides Act.  

**Court's Findings:**  
- The court noted that Ethephon is not being sold or stored with consumable food items, and its use is regulated under FSSAI guidelines.  
- The court emphasized that the FSSAI has the authority to issue directions regarding food safety and that the use of Ethephon in controlled conditions does not violate the law.  
- The court found no conflict between the FSSAI's directive and the statutory provisions of the Insecticides Act or the Food Safety and Standards Act.  

**Final Decision:**  
The court dismissed the PIL (W.P. (PIL) No. 176 of 2020) and the other writ petitions (W.P. Nos. 3272 and 3719 of 2021), concluding that the FSSAI's directive regarding Ethephon is valid and does not pose a health risk when used according to the established guidelines.

112,Narasus_Coffee_Company_vs_The_Food_Inspector_on_4_January_2022.PDF,"In the case of Narasus Coffee Company vs The Food Inspector, the petitioner, Narasus Coffee Company, represented by Mr. S. Hariharan, sought to quash the proceedings in C.C. No. 77 of 2010 pending before the Judicial Magistrate – II, Tiruppur. The respondent in this case was the Food Inspector of Tiruppur City Municipal Corporation. 

The background of the case dates back to September 24, 2008, when the Food Inspector purchased six packets of 100 grams of coffee powder from Sri Selvakumar Departmental Stores and sent them for analysis to the Public Analyst in Salem. The Public Analyst's report, dated October 22, 2008, indicated that the coffee powder was 'misbranded' due to non-compliance with labeling requirements as per Rule 37 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Rules, 1955. The respondent informed the petitioner of this finding on October 23, 2008.

The petitioner’s counsel argued that under Section 13(2) of the PFA Act, 1954, the petitioner had the right to have the sample analyzed by the Central Food Laboratory, which was not afforded to them. Additionally, the counsel pointed out that Rule 11(4) of the PFA Act requires that samples be sent for analysis within seven days, and the subsequent Food Safety and Standards Act prescribes a one-year limit for prosecution from the date of the offense. The prosecution in this case was initiated after one and a half years, which the petitioner claimed violated both Acts.

The court noted that the petitioner had previously filed a similar petition (Crl.O.P. No. 9007 of 2011) to quash the same case, which was dismissed as withdrawn on April 26, 2017. The court held that since the earlier petition was dismissed, the petitioner could not refile the same request. Consequently, the court dismissed the current petition, instructing the Judicial Magistrate – II, Tiruppur, to resolve the case within six months from the receipt of the order.

The charges against him included Section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc.), Section 272 (selling noxious food or drink), Section 273 (selling noxious food or drink for human consumption), all read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Section 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The applicant's counsel argued that the only non-bailable charge was under Section 328 of the IPC, and referenced a Supreme Court decision (Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs. State of Kerala) and a prior order from the Aurangabad Bench, which suggested that Section 328 may not apply if there was no intent to administer an intoxicant. The counsel also noted a conflicting view from a Mumbai bench, which was under challenge in the Supreme Court, where interim protection had been granted to the petitioner.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) requested time to review the cited judgments before making further submissions. The court noted the conflicting interpretations of Section 328 and decided to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant.

The court's order included the following conditions: 
1. In the event of arrest, the applicant would be released on bail upon executing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties of the same amount.
2. The applicant was required to report to the Investigating Officer on March 7 and 8, 2022, between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., and as directed thereafter.

Sewlikar, addressed a bail application filed by the applicant, Nasir Mohammedail Yeligar, on January 24, 2022. The applicant was seeking bail in connection with Crime No. 0467/2021 registered at Karmad Police Station, Aurangabad, for multiple offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The allegations against Yeligar stemmed from an incident on December 6, 2021, where he was found transporting a banned food product, 'Najar 9000 Gutkha', in an Eicher truck. The police seized 83 gunny bags containing a total of 28,303 pouches of the banned substance, valued at approximately Rs. 70,75,750. The State of Maharashtra has prohibited all forms of Gutkha, leading to Yeligar's arrest as the truck driver.

The applicant's counsel, Mr. R.A. Jaiswal, argued that Section 328 of the IPC, which pertains to administering drugs or poisons, should not apply to Yeligar since he was unaware of the contents of the gunny bags. He contended that the prosecution failed to establish that Yeligar had knowledge of the illegal nature of the goods he was transporting.

Conversely, the Assistant Public Prosecutor (APP), Mr. G.O. Wattamwar, maintained that the applicant was aware of the contents and intended to harm consumers by transporting the banned substance. He referenced a previous ruling by a Division Bench of the High Court that supported the application of Section 328 in similar cases.

The court noted that while the legality of invoking Section 328 is currently under review by the Supreme Court, there was insufficient evidence to prove that Yeligar was an employee of the company producing the Gutkha or the supplier, which would imply knowledge or intent regarding the banned substance. Furthermore, the court highlighted that the maximum punishment for the offences charged was not severe enough to warrant denial of bail, as the most serious charge carried a potential sentence of up to 10 years.

Ultimately, the court granted the bail application, allowing Yeligar to be released on a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one local solvent surety. Conditions were imposed to ensure he would not tamper with evidence or pressure witnesses and that he would attend trial proceedings regularly. The application was thus disposed of favorably for the applicant.","High Court of Judicature of Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad",['Nasir Mohammedail Yeligar'],['The State of Maharashtra'],['M.G.

The F.I.R. included charges under Sections 420 (cheating), 272 (adulteration of food or drink), and 273 (sale of noxious food or drink) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, as well as Sections 57(1), 58, and 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and Section 34(a) of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968.

The court, presided over by Justice Cheekati Manavendranath Roy, heard arguments from both the petitioner's counsel and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State. The judge noted that this case was similar to previous cases where the court had quashed F.I.R.s for similar offences based on identical facts, specifically referencing earlier common orders in Criminal Petition Nos.5421 of 2019 and batch, as well as Criminal Petition Nos.2966 of 2021 and batch.

The court concluded that the petitioner was entitled to have the F.I.R. quashed for the offences under Sections 420, 272, 273 of the IPC and Sections 57(1), 58, and 59 of the F.S.S. Act, as these were covered by the earlier rulings. However, the court determined that the current case was not covered by the previous orders concerning the offence under Section 34(a) of the Excise Act, and therefore, the F.I.R. related to that specific charge could not be quashed.

The estimated cost of the tender was Rs. 36.92 crores, covering 3983 schools. 

The petitioner, represented by Senior Advocate Mr. Prasad Dhakephalkar, contested the eligibility of the 3rd Respondent, who had submitted a bid for the tender. The petitioner claimed that the 3rd Respondent did not possess a valid license under the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSAI) as required by the tender conditions. The tendering authority had previously clarified that a receipt or challan evidencing an application for registration would suffice due to the time-consuming nature of obtaining the FSSAI license, especially during lockdowns.

However, it was revealed that the 3rd Respondent did not obtain a valid FSSAI license until 25th November 2021, which was after the technical bids were opened on 30th September 2021. The petitioner pointed out that the challan submitted by the 3rd Respondent was dated 16th June 2021, but the online status indicated that the application had been rejected, suggesting that the 3rd Respondent was not technically qualified to bid.

The court, acknowledging the discrepancies and the lack of a valid FSSAI license for the 3rd Respondent at the relevant times, decided to grant interim protection by ordering that the tendering authority should not proceed with the award of the tender until further orders from the court. The court also directed the State's representative, Mr. PP Kakade, to file a proper affidavit addressing the points raised by the petitioner by 31st January 2022. The matter was scheduled for a further hearing on 2nd February 2022, with instructions for the petitioner's advocate to notify the 3rd Respondent.

The application was in relation to a criminal case registered under Section 328 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 41 and 88 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, at the Uttan Sagari Police Station.

The applicant's counsel argued that the previous application for anticipatory bail had been withdrawn and that Section 328 of the IPC was not applicable to the case. They contended that there was no evidence implicating the applicant in the alleged crime and referenced a Supreme Court order that provided relief from coercive action in similar matters.

Conversely, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) highlighted that the applicant had been absconding for over a year and that his previous bail application had been rejected by the court. The APP pointed out that the court had previously ruled against the argument that Section 328 of the IPC was not applicable in similar cases, citing orders from earlier applications that had been dismissed.

The court noted that the applicant had been evading arrest and that the previous application had been disposed of after the applicant requested to withdraw it. The court also referenced its earlier decisions regarding the non-applicability of Section 328 in similar contexts, concluding that no new grounds had been presented to warrant reconsideration of the bail application.

Ultimately, the court rejected the anticipatory bail application, stating that the applicant had failed to make a case for the relief sought.

This charge sheet was filed in the Judicial Magistrate's Court of First Class in Koilakuntla, Kurnool District, and included allegations of offences under Sections 188, 273, 328 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as Sections 58, 59(i) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and Section 7(a) read with 8(e) of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act.

During the hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the case was similar to a previous ruling by the court in Criminal Petition Nos.5421 of 2019 and batch, where several charge sheets for similar offences were quashed based on identical facts. The counsel contended that the petitioners in the current case were similarly situated and thus entitled to the same relief.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor acknowledged that this case was indeed covered by the earlier common order and agreed to the quashing of the charge sheet.

The charges against him included various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) such as Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection), Section 273 (selling noxious food or drink), and Section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc.), as well as several provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the Epidemic Diseases Act.

The applicant's counsel argued that the only non-bailable charge was under Section 328 of the IPC, and referenced a Supreme Court decision (Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs.

**Court:** Supreme Court of India  
**Judges:** A.M. Khanwilkar, C.T. Ravikumar  
**Parties:**  
- **Appellant:** Nkgsb Cooperative Bank Limited  
- **Respondents:** Subir Chakravarty & Others  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 14(1A) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act). The primary question was whether a District Magistrate (DM) or Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) can appoint an advocate to take possession of secured assets on behalf of a secured creditor.

**High Court Decisions:**  
1. The Bombay High Court ruled that the appointment of an advocate by the CMM/DM was illegal, stating that the advocate is not a subordinate officer to the CMM/DM.  
2. Conversely, the Madras High Court held that an advocate is considered an officer of the court and thus subordinate to the CMM/DM, allowing the appointment of an advocate commissioner to assist in taking possession of secured assets.

**Conflicting Views:**  
The Supreme Court noted a conflict between the Bombay High Court's strict interpretation and the more flexible interpretations by the High Courts of Kerala, Madras, and Delhi, which allowed for the appointment of advocates as commissioners.

**Arguments Presented:**  
- The secured creditors argued that the CMM/DM should have the discretion to appoint advocates to facilitate the process of taking possession, especially given the logistical challenges faced by these magistrates.
- The borrowers contended that the law explicitly requires the appointment of subordinate officers, and advocates do not fit this definition.

**Supreme Court's Findings:**  
1. The Court emphasized that the term ""any officer subordinate to him"" in Section 14(1A) should be interpreted in a functional context, allowing for the appointment of advocates as they are officers of the court.
2. The Court acknowledged the practical difficulties faced by CMMs/DMs due to limited resources and the high volume of cases, which justified the need for appointing advocates to assist in the execution of orders.
3. The Court concluded that the appointment of an advocate commissioner does not violate the statutory provisions and aligns with the legislative intent of the SARFAESI Act.

**Final Decision:**  
- The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by the secured creditors, thereby overturning the Bombay High Court's decision and affirming the legality of appointing advocates as commissioners under Section 14(1A) of the SARFAESI Act.
- The special leave petition filed by the borrowers against the Madras High Court's decision was delinked for separate consideration regarding compliance with procedural requirements under Section 14.

**Conclusion:**  
The judgment clarifies that CMMs/DMs can appoint advocates to assist in taking possession of secured assets, recognizing advocates as officers of the court and thus subordinate for the purposes of the SARFAESI Act.",Supreme Court of India,['NKGSB Cooperative Bank Limited'],"['Subir Chakravarty', 'Canara Bank', 'State of Maharashtra']","['C.T.

The charges included violations of the A.P. Gaming Act (specifically related to cricket betting), as well as several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act).

The petitioner’s counsel argued that the prosecution under Section 188 IPC was invalid due to the lack of a complaint from the concerned authority who issued the initial order that was allegedly violated.

**Court:** Gauhati High Court  
**Date of Judgment:** 30 March 2022  
**Judges:** Rumi Kumari Phukan  
**Case Number:** Crl.Pet./490/2021  
**Key Parties:**  
- **Petitioners:** M/S. Norphel Winery, represented by Shri Phurpa Tsering, and Shri Purna Bahadur Gurung  
- **Respondents:** The State of Assam and six others, including the Chief Secretary, Commissioner of Excise, and various Excise officials.  
  
**Background:**  
The petitioners sought to quash the proceedings related to Dibrugarh P.S. Case No.66 (Excise)/2021, which was registered under Section 53(1)(a) of the Assam Excise (Amendment) Act, 2018. The case arose from the seizure of a consignment of Kiwi Wine being transported from Dirang, Arunachal Pradesh, to Khonsa, Arunachal Pradesh, via Assam. The Excise Department of Assam seized the vehicle and the wine due to alleged discrepancies in the quantity and lack of required labeling information.  
  
**Arguments by the Petitioners:**  
1. **Legal Transport:** The petitioners argued that the transport of the wine was legal as it was intended for delivery within Arunachal Pradesh and was merely passing through Assam due to lack of direct road connectivity.  
2. **Documentation:** They produced valid documents, including a transit challan and a permit from the Arunachal Pradesh Excise Department, which allowed the transport of the wine.  
3. **Discrepancies:** The discrepancies in the quantity were attributed to typographical errors in the documents, and they contended that the absence of batch numbers and manufacturing dates did not render the wine unfit for consumption under the applicable regulations.  
4. **Jurisdiction:** The petitioners argued that the Assam Excise Department lacked jurisdiction to seize the goods as the wine was not intended for sale in Assam and was exempt from taxes in Arunachal Pradesh.  
5. **Recent Amendments:** They cited recent amendments to the Assam Excise Rules, which they claimed provided further clarity on the legality of their actions.  
  
**Arguments by the Respondents:**  
1. **Seizure Justification:** The respondents contended that the seizure was justified due to the lack of a proper road permit and discrepancies in the invoices presented during the transport.  
2. **Safety Concerns:** They raised concerns regarding the safety and labeling of the wine, stating that it was misbranded and unsafe for human consumption based on laboratory analysis.  
3. **Authority to Act:** The respondents maintained that the Excise Department had the authority to act under the Assam Excise Act, as the transport of liquor was regulated by state law.  
  
**Court's Findings:**  
1. **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The court found that the Assam Excise Department did not have jurisdiction over the transport of the wine, as it was intended for delivery within Arunachal Pradesh and was merely passing through Assam.  
2. **Validity of Documents:** The court accepted the validity of the documents provided by the petitioners, including the clarification from the Arunachal Pradesh Excise Department regarding the discrepancies in the permits.  
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** The court noted that the petitioners complied with the relevant rules and that the wine was not intended for sale in Assam, thus negating the basis for the seizure.  
4. **Quashing of Proceedings:** Ultimately, the court quashed the proceedings against the petitioners, stating that the initiation of the case by the Assam Excise Department was improper.  
  
**Final Decision:**

The petitioners, Sambhu Singha, Dipanjal Sonowal, and Raju Singha, sought the implementation of a government notification (Notification No. FSC.12/2013/11) issued on January 12, 2021, by the Commissionerate of Food Safety, Assam. This notification prohibited the use of tobacco and/or nicotine in food products, specifically targeting items like Gutkha and Pan Masala, citing health concerns under the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions of Sales) Regulations, 2011, and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The petitioners argued that the State Government had failed to implement this notification, which was intended to protect public health by banning the manufacture, storage, transportation, display, distribution, or sale of these harmful products for a period of one year.

However, upon reviewing the case, the court noted that the notification was only effective for one year from its issuance, meaning it would have expired on January 11, 2022. Since the notification had already lapsed, the court deemed the writ petition to be infructuous, meaning it no longer had any practical effect or purpose.

**Court:** Additional Sessions Judge-04, New Delhi District, Patiala House Courts  
**Date of Judgment:** 09 March 2022  
**Unique Case ID:** DLND01-009694/2016  
**Criminal Appeal Number:** 8731/2016  
**CC Number:** 47/2011  
**Relevant Sections:** Sections 7/16 of the PFA Act, 1954  
  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Appellant:** Pawan Aggarwal, S/o Sh. Biharilal Aggarwal  
- **Respondent:** Delhi Administration/Food Inspector, Department of PFA, Govt of NCT of Delhi  
  
**Background:**  
Pawan Aggarwal was convicted on 02 September 2016 for selling adulterated food products, specifically 'Pista Burfi', which contained aluminum leaves instead of silver leaves and undeclared hydrogenated vegetable oil. He was sentenced to two years of simple imprisonment and fined Rs. 50,000. The conviction was based on evidence collected during a raid on his sweet shop on 23 August 2010, where food safety officials collected samples that were later found to be adulterated.  
  
**Appeal Details:**  
Pawan Aggarwal filed an appeal on 08 September 2016, challenging both the conviction and the sentence. During the hearing on 09 March 2022, his counsel argued that the PFA Act had been repealed and replaced by the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSSAI), which provided for lesser penalties for similar offenses. The appellant sought a lenient view based on his personal circumstances, including his family responsibilities and the prolonged duration of the trial.  
  
**Arguments:**  
- **For the Appellant:**  
  - The new FSSAI legislation should apply, which has diluted the penalties for food safety violations.  
  - The appellant has faced significant hardship during the 11 years of trial, which should be considered as a form of punishment.  
  - The appellant is a family man with dependents and has no prior offenses.  
  
- **For the Respondent:**  
  - The definitions of offenses under the new Act differ significantly from those under the PFA Act, making it inappropriate to apply the new law retroactively.  
  
**Court's Decision:**  
The court acknowledged the arguments regarding the new legislation and the appellant's circumstances. It ruled that the appellant was entitled to the benefits of the new FSSAI law. The original sentence was modified:  
- The two-year imprisonment was replaced with a term of TRC (Trial Release Condition).  
- The fine was increased to Rs. 1,25,000 from Rs. 50,000.  
  
The appellant was directed to pay the modified fine within eight weeks. The appeal was partly allowed, with the conviction upheld but the sentence modified.  
  
**Conclusion:**  
The appeal was disposed of with the modified sentence reflecting the new legal framework, emphasizing the court's consideration of the appellant's personal circumstances and the legislative changes in food safety laws.","Court of Shri Anil Antil, Additional Sessions Judge-04, New Delhi District, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi",['Pawan Aggarwal'],"['Delhi Administration/Food Inspector, Department of PFA, Govt of NCT of Delhi']",['Anil Antil'],09-03-2022,"['Department of PFA, Govt of NCT of Delhi']","['New Delhi', 'Delhi']","['Section 7 of P.F.A Act-1954', 'Section 16(1)(a) of P.F.A Act-1954']","['PFA Act, 1954', 'Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSSAI)']","['Nemi Chand Vs.

**Court:** High Court of Kerala  
**Date:** 3 February 2022  
**Judgment by:** Justice Ziyad Rahman A.A.  
**Crl.M.C No.:** 6479 of 2017  
**Key Parties:**  
- **Petitioner/Accused No. 7:** Pepsico India Holdings Private Limited, represented by Mr. Luv S. Kapil.  
- **Respondents/State/Complainant:**  
  1. The State of Kerala, represented by Public Prosecutor Sri. Aravind V. Mathew.  
  2. P.K. Mohanan, Senior Inspector, Legal Metrology.  

**Background:**  
The case arose from a complaint filed by the second respondent, P.K. Mohanan, against Pepsico India Holdings and six other accused, alleging violations of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 and the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. The complaint was based on an inspection conducted on 19 August 2016 at M/s. PVR Cinemas, where it was found that the declarations on the Aquafina packaged drinking water were not legible and prominent, violating the relevant legal provisions.  

**Key Allegations:**  
1. The statutory declarations on the Aquafina bottles were not legible and complete.  
2. The maximum retail price (MRP) and the month/year of packing were not adequately displayed.  
3. Other accused were involved in selling items in non-standard units of weight/measures.  

**Legal Arguments:**  
- The petitioner contended that the violations under Rule 9(1)(a) of the Rules, 2011 were not applicable since packaged drinking water is classified as 'food' under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.  
- The petitioner argued that the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act should take precedence over the Legal Metrology Rules, particularly regarding the declarations required on food packaging.  
- The court examined the definitions and provisions of both the Legal Metrology Rules and the Food Safety and Standards Act, concluding that the specific allegations regarding the retail price and legibility of declarations were valid and not exempted by the Food Safety Act.  
- The court noted that the complaint's focus was on the legibility of the declarations, which is a factual matter to be determined at trial, not suitable for dismissal at this stage.  

**Court's Findings:**  
1. The court found that the provisions of the Legal Metrology Rules still apply to packaged drinking water, despite it being classified as food.  
2. The specific allegations regarding the failure to provide legible and prominent declarations regarding the retail price and manufacturing date were upheld.  
3. The court emphasized that the question of legibility is a matter of evidence and should be addressed during the trial.  
4. The court ruled that the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. could not be invoked to dismiss the case, as the allegations, if accepted as true, constituted an offense.

**Background:**  
Pikani Bai filed an appeal seeking enhancement of compensation after being dissatisfied with the award of Rs. 45,000 granted by the Senior Civil Judge & JMFC, Hiriyur, in MVC No. 941/2016. The claim arose from an accident on 24 June 2015, where the claimant was struck by a KSRTC bus while walking on the road, resulting in significant injuries including rib fractures.

**Key Points of the Judgement:**  
1. **Accident Details:**  
   - The claimant was walking on NH-4 when a KSRTC bus, driven rashly and negligently, hit her.  
   - She sustained injuries to her face, leg, and chest, including fractures of the 7th and 8th ribs, requiring hospitalization for about a month.

2. **Claim for Compensation:**  
   - The claimant sought compensation for medical expenses, loss of income, pain and suffering, and other related costs due to the accident.
   - The respondents denied negligence on the part of the bus driver, claiming the accident was due to the claimant's own negligence.

3. **Tribunal's Findings:**  
   - The Tribunal awarded Rs. 45,000, which the appellant argued was inadequate given the severity of her injuries and the impact on her life.
   - The Tribunal's award included Rs. 10,000 for pain and suffering, Rs. 10,000 for attendant and nourishment, and Rs. 25,000 for medical expenses.

4. **Arguments for Enhancement:**  
   - The appellant's counsel argued that the compensation did not reflect the injuries sustained and failed to account for loss of income during recovery.
   - The respondents contended that the awarded amount was reasonable and based on the evidence presented.

5. **Court's Analysis:**  
   - The court found that the claimant's injuries were indeed severe and that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal was insufficient.
   - The court accepted the discharge summary as evidence of the claimant's hospitalization and the need for recovery time.
   - The court determined a notional income of Rs. 9,000 per month for the claimant, leading to a calculation for loss of income during her recovery period.

6. **Final Decision:**  
   - The court enhanced the total compensation to Rs. 1,07,000, breaking it down as follows:  
     - Pain and Suffering: Rs. 25,000  
     - Attendant, Food, and Nourishment: Rs. 30,000  
     - Loss of Income during Laid Up Period: Rs. 27,000  
     - Loss of Amenities: Rs. 25,000

**Date of Judgment:** 07 January 2022  

**Parties Involved:**  
- **Appellant:** Poonam Sethi (Wife)  
- **Respondent:** Sanjay Sethi (Husband)  

**Background:**  
Poonam Sethi filed an appeal against the Family Court's judgment dated 28 November 2020, which granted her a divorce on the grounds of cruelty but denied her maintenance and alimony for herself and her two major daughters. The couple married on 11 October 1986 and had three children: Sahiba, Ananya, and Atharv. Poonam claimed that she had been solely responsible for raising the children since 2010, with no financial support from Sanjay.

**Key Arguments:**  
1. **Appellant's Claims:**  
   - Poonam argued that she was entitled to maintenance for herself and her daughters, as she had been the primary caregiver and provider for over a decade.  
   - She cited the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, asserting that the husband has a legal obligation to maintain his wife and unmarried daughters.  
   - Poonam highlighted that her daughters, despite being adults, were still dependent on her for their needs, including marriage expenses.

2. **Respondent's Defense:**  
   - Sanjay contended that Poonam was earning a substantial income and that both daughters were also financially independent.  
   - He argued that since the daughters were major, they were not entitled to maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act.

**Family Court's Findings:**  
- The Family Court ruled that Poonam was not entitled to maintenance or alimony for herself or her major daughters, stating that the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act only apply to minor children.  
- It granted Poonam Rs. 25,000 per month for her minor son, Atharv, until he reached the age of majority.

**High Court's Judgment:**  
- The High Court upheld the Family Court's decision regarding Poonam's maintenance but disagreed with the ruling on the daughters.  
- The court emphasized that a father has a legal and moral obligation to support his unmarried daughters, regardless of their employment status.  
- It ruled that both daughters were entitled to maintenance for their marriage expenses, recognizing the cultural expectations surrounding marriage in Indian society.
- The court ordered Sanjay to pay Rs. 35 lakhs for Sahiba's marriage and Rs. 50 lakhs for Ananya's marriage, to be paid within specified timeframes.

**Conclusion:**  
- The appeal was partially allowed, with the court directing Sanjay to fulfill his financial obligations towards his daughters' marriages, while maintaining the Family Court's decision regarding Poonam's maintenance.

The F.I.R. charged him with offences under Sections 270 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 24(1) read with Section 25(1) of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. 

The petitioner’s counsel argued that the case was similar to previous cases where the High Court had quashed several F.I.R.s based on identical facts, specifically referencing Criminal Petition Nos. 5421 of 2019 and others. The counsel contended that the police lacked jurisdiction to investigate offences under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and that the transport or storage of tobacco products did not constitute an offence under the IPC sections cited. 

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor acknowledged that the matter was indeed covered by the earlier common order of the court and agreed to the quashing of the F.I.R.

  - V8 Pool Inc. (in Comm. Appeal No. 108 of 2021)  
  - m.t. GP Asphalt I (in Comm. Appeal No. 111 of 2021)  
  
**Background:**  
The case revolves around the issue of whether crew wages accrued on board the vessel m.t. GP Asphalt I after its arrest by the Admiralty Court should be classified as Sheriff's expenses. The vessel was arrested on December 22, 2020, and the crew had not been paid their wages since November 2020. The Swedish Club, as the Protection and Indemnity Club, sought to make payments for the crew's wages and maintenance, claiming these should be treated as Sheriff's expenses.  
  
**Judgment Overview:**  
1. **Swedish Club's Application:**  
   - The Swedish Club filed an application to pay crew wages and other expenses, which was initially disallowed by the Ld. Single Judge. The Judge ruled that the Club could not claim these payments as Sheriff's expenses since they were made under an obligation imposed by the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC).  
2. **Crew Members' Application:**  
   - The crew members also filed an application for their wages accrued post-arrest to be treated as Sheriff's expenses, which was similarly disallowed.  
3. **Appeals:**  
   - Both the Swedish Club and the crew members appealed against the respective orders.  
4. **Court's Findings:**  
   - The court found that the Swedish Club acted promptly in seeking leave to make payments for the crew's benefit and that the crew had no grievances against the Club's actions.  
   - The court emphasized that the well-being of the crew and the preservation of the vessel were paramount, and thus, payments made for these purposes should be classified as Sheriff's expenses.  
   - The court also noted that the MLC allows for the P&I Club to stand in the shoes of the crew after making payments, thus entitling the Club to claim these amounts as Sheriff's expenses.  
5. **Final Decision:**  
   - The court allowed both appeals:  
     - The Crew Members were entitled to payment of $11,133.31 for wages accrued from March 1 to March 20, 2021, as Sheriff's expenses.  
     - The Swedish Club was entitled to payment of $64,663 for wages accrued from December 22, 2020, to February 28, 2021, as Sheriff's expenses.  
     - The Swedish Club was also granted the status of a maritime lien for payments made for wages accrued prior to the arrest.  
  
**Guidelines Established:**  
The court established guidelines for handling cases of abandoned vessels under arrest, emphasizing the need for prompt action by the Admiralty Court to ensure the welfare of the crew and the preservation of the vessel. These guidelines included procedures for reporting abandonment, making necessary supplies, and handling claims for expenses incurred during the period of arrest.",High Court of Judicature at Bombay,"['Pradeep', 'Swedish Club']","['m.t.

However, it provided a pathway for the petitioner by stating that if he surrenders to the lower court and applies for bail within four weeks, the court should expedite the hearing of his bail application. The court also instructed that the claim of parity with co-accused individuals should be considered during the bail adjudication process.

The case records were ordered to be made available to the concerned court, and the application for anticipatory bail was disposed of accordingly. The parties were informed that they could access a soft copy of the order from the High Court's website, which would hold the same validity as a certified copy.

In summary, the court denied the anticipatory bail request but allowed for a future bail application upon surrender, emphasizing the need for a prompt hearing.",High Court of Orissa at Cuttack,['Pradip Sahoo'],['State of Odisha'],['S.K.

134,Pravin_Prakash_Kadam_vs_State_Of_Maharashtra_on_28_February_2022.PDF,"In the case of Pravin Prakash Kadam vs. The State of Maharashtra, the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, presided over by Justice C.V. Bhadang, addressed an anticipatory bail application filed by the applicant, Pravin Prakash Kadam, on February 28, 2022. The applicant was apprehending arrest in connection with Crime No. 808/2021, which involved allegations under various sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2003, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including Section 328, which pertains to administering substances with the intent to commit an offense.

The prosecution's case stemmed from a raid where banned Goa Gutkha products were recovered from a Tata Indigo car belonging to the applicant. The applicant's counsel argued that the only non-bailable charge was under Section 328 of the IPC, and cited a Supreme Court decision (Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs. State of Kerala) and a prior order from the Aurangabad Bench, which suggested that Section 328 may not apply in similar circumstances, as there was no evidence of intent to administer an intoxicant.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) requested time to review the cited judgments before making further submissions. The court noted that a conflicting view had been taken by a different bench in Mumbai, which was under challenge in the Supreme Court, where interim protection had been granted to the petitioner.

In light of these considerations, the court granted anticipatory bail to Pravin Prakash Kadam, stipulating that he be released on a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties. The applicant was ordered to report to the Investigating Officer on specified dates and to cooperate with the investigation, ensuring that he would not tamper with evidence or witnesses.

**Judgement Date:** 29 January 2022

  3. Ajay Kumar Mittal  
- **Defendants:**  
  1. Saurabh Tanwar  
  2. North Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD)  

**Background:**  
The plaintiffs, owners of a property located at 4, Vaishali, Pitampura, Delhi, filed a suit against the defendants for possession, recovery of arrears of rent, mesne profits, and damages. The property was leased to defendant no.1, Saurabh Tanwar, for a period of nine years starting from July 10, 2018, at a monthly rent of Rs. 4,51,000. The lease was formalized through a registered lease deed.  

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Sealing of Property:** The property was sealed by the North MCD on February 24, 2020, due to the defendant's failure to obtain a Municipal Health Trade License necessary for operating a restaurant, which was being run under the name ""Sankalp Restaurant.""  
2. **Non-Payment of Rent:** The defendant failed to pay rent since February 2020, leading to the plaintiffs terminating the lease on May 30, 2020, due to non-payment for two consecutive months as stipulated in the lease agreement.  
3. **False Representations:** The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant made false representations regarding obtaining the necessary licenses and continued to operate the restaurant without proper authorization.  
4. **Possession Issues:** The plaintiffs sought possession of the property, claiming that the defendant was in illegal possession after the lease termination.  

**Court Findings:**  
- The court found that the defendant had not procured the necessary licenses to operate the restaurant and had continued to run the business despite the sealing of the property.  
- The court noted that the defendant admitted to the lease agreement but failed to provide evidence of rent payments or compliance with the lease terms regarding obtaining licenses.  
- The court determined that the plaintiffs had validly terminated the lease and were entitled to recover possession of the property.  
- The court also acknowledged the plaintiffs' claim for arrears of rent and damages but noted that the specifics of the claim were not sufficiently detailed in the plaint.  

**Final Decision:**  
The court granted a decree of possession in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the defendant to vacate the property. The court clarified that the plaintiffs were not authorized to break the seal placed by the MCD and that they could seek legal remedies for de-sealing the property. The court allowed the application for summary judgment under Order 13A CPC partly, with the suit for arrears of rent and damages to continue.  

**Conclusion:**  
The judgement emphasized the importance of compliance with statutory requirements for operating a business and upheld the plaintiffs' rights to reclaim their property due to the defendant's breach of lease terms.","District Judge (Commercial Court) North West District, Rohini Courts, Delhi","['Pritam Kumar Mittal', 'Smt.

**Court:** LXXXVIII Addl. City Civil & Sessions Judge (Exclusive Commercial Court), Bengaluru City  
**Date:** January 4, 2022  
**Judgment Overview:**  
This case involves a dispute between the Pupil Tree Foundation (the plaintiffs) and Pearson India Education Services (the defendant) regarding an arbitration award issued on November 30, 2019. The plaintiffs sought to set aside the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which directed them to pay the defendant a sum of Rs. 8,40,22,056 along with interest, while also denying the plaintiffs' counterclaim for liquidated damages amounting to Rs. 3,09,60,000.  
**Key Parties:**  
- **Plaintiffs:**  
  1. Pupil Tree Foundation  
  2. Mr. Prabhu Jahagirdar  
  3. Mrs. Sucharita Sriram Jahagirdar  
- **Defendant:**  
  Pearson India Education Services Private Limited  
**Background:**  
The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant was appointed as the exclusive service provider for educational support services under a 20-year agreement. The defendant paid a refundable security deposit of Rs. 7,25,00,000 to the plaintiffs, which was used to discharge a bank loan. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant failed to fulfill its obligations under the agreement, leading to a breach and subsequent termination of the contract. The defendant, on the other hand, claimed that the plaintiffs were in breach and sought the return of the security deposit along with annual service fees and liquidated damages.  
**Arbitration Proceedings:**  
The arbitration was initiated after the defendant terminated the agreement and invoked the arbitration clause. The sole arbitrator ruled in favor of the defendant, ordering the plaintiffs to refund the security deposit and pay annual service fees. The plaintiffs contested this award, arguing that the arbitrator failed to consider the breaches committed by the defendant and that the award was contrary to the terms of the agreement.  
**Court's Findings:**  
1. **Grounds for Setting Aside the Award:**  
   - The court found that the plaintiffs did not establish any grounds under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act to set aside the award.  
   - The arbitrator's decision to refund the security deposit was deemed valid as the agreement did not provide for forfeiture in case of the defendant's non-performance.  
   - The claim for annual service consideration was not barred by limitation, as the arbitration proceedings commenced within the prescribed period.  
   - The court noted that the arbitrator had considered both parties' claims and counterclaims, and the plaintiffs' claims for damages were rejected based on a lack of evidence.  
2. **Legal Principles:**  
   - The court reiterated that it cannot reassess the merits of the arbitration award and can only interfere if the award is contrary to public policy or the terms of the contract.  
   - The court emphasized that the scope of interference is limited and that the arbitrator's findings are generally binding unless there is a clear violation of law or contract terms.  
**Final Decision:**  
The court dismissed the plaintiffs' petition to set aside the arbitration award, affirming the arbitrator's decision and ordering no costs. The judgment reinforced the principle that arbitration awards are to be respected unless there are compelling reasons to overturn them.","LXXXVIII Addl.

During the hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the matter was covered by a previous common order issued by the court in Criminal Petition Nos.5421 of 2019 and related cases, where several FIRs with similar charges were quashed based on identical facts. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor acknowledged this point and agreed that the current case was indeed a covered matter.

The petitions sought to quash criminal prosecutions initiated against them for alleged violations of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, following inspections and subsequent complaints filed by the Food Safety Officer, Thiru.P.Jaganathan.

The respondent, Thiru.P.Jaganathan, conducted an inspection on October 10, 2013, and collected samples of sago powder, which were later analyzed. The analysis revealed that the samples did not meet the required standards, leading to the filing of complaints in January and March 2016. The petitioners contended that they were not the manufacturers of the sago powder and thus should not be held liable for the alleged violations. They also argued that the prosecution was initiated beyond the statutory time limits set by the Food Safety and Standards Act, specifically citing that the request for sanction to prosecute was made after the mandatory fourteen-day period following the receipt of the analysis report.

The petitioners' counsel highlighted that the complaints were filed more than a year after the alleged offenses, which contravened Section 77 of the Act, which stipulates a one-year limit for prosecution unless extended by the Commissioner of Food Safety for valid reasons. The petitioners argued that the reasons provided for the delay were vague and insufficient.

In response, the Government Advocate for the respondent maintained that the delays were due to administrative reasons and that the two separate complaints were justified as they stemmed from two different samples taken during the same inspection.

Upon reviewing the case, Justice V.Bharathidasan found that the respondent had indeed failed to adhere to the mandatory provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act. The court noted that the request for prosecution was not made within the required timeframe and that the reasons provided for the delay were not adequately substantiated. Furthermore, the court ruled that two separate prosecutions for the same contravention based on two samples taken from the same product were not permissible.

Consequently, the court quashed both criminal prosecutions (STC No.249 of 2016 and STC No.146 of 2016) against the petitioners, allowing their petitions and closing the connected motions.

**Judge:** Deepak Kumar Agarwal  
**Case Number:** MCRC-60241-2021  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Applicant:** Radhey Shyam Sharma  
- **Respondent:** State of Madhya Pradesh  

**Background:**  
The applicant, Radhey Shyam Sharma, filed a first anticipatory bail application under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) due to apprehension of arrest in connection with Crime No. 758/2021 registered at Police Station Joura, District Morena. The charges against him include Sections 420 (cheating), 272 (adulteration of food or drink), and 273 (sale of noxious food or drink) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  

On November 23, 2021, a team of Food Safety Officers conducted a search of a vehicle belonging to the applicant, where they found 700 liters of milk and a solution intended for mixing with the milk. The applicant was present at the scene and allegedly attempted to mix the solution into the milk. The officers took samples for analysis and destroyed the seized solution to prevent its use in adulteration. An FIR was subsequently filed against the applicant.  

**Arguments:**  
- **For the Applicant:**  
  - The applicant's counsel argued that Sharma is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case.  
  - He expressed the applicant's willingness to cooperate with the investigation and abide by any conditions set by the court.  

- **For the State:**  
  - The Public Prosecutor opposed the bail application, requesting its dismissal.  

**Court's Analysis:**  
The court reviewed the case diary and noted that the offences under Sections 272 and 273 IPC are bailable, while Section 420 IPC carries a maximum punishment of up to seven years. The court referenced the Supreme Court's ruling in *Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar*, which stipulates that police should only arrest individuals in such cases if necessary, particularly if the accused does not cooperate with the investigation.  

The court emphasized the following points from the *Arnesh Kumar* case:  
1. Arrest should only occur if necessary to prevent further offences, ensure proper investigation, or prevent evidence tampering.  
2. Police must document reasons for arrest or for not making an arrest.  
3. The police should first summon the accused to cooperate in the investigation before considering arrest.  
4. Section 41-A Cr.P.C. mandates that if arrest is not required, a notice should be issued to the accused to appear before the police.  

**Decision:**  
The court granted anticipatory bail to Radhey Shyam Sharma with the following conditions:  
1. The police may arrest the applicant only if he fails to cooperate with the investigation.  
2. The applicant must be summoned to cooperate in the investigation first.  
3. The applicant is required to provide a written undertaking to comply with health and safety regulations related to COVID-19.

140,Rahul_Kumar_vs_The_State_Of_Bihar_Through_Principal_on_9_February_2022.PDF,"In the case of Rahul Kumar vs The State of Bihar, the petitioner, Rahul Kumar, sought to quash the prosecution initiated against him under the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, specifically for the alleged possession of non-alcoholic beer that was claimed to contain ethyl alcohol above permissible limits. The case arose from a raid conducted by the Assistant Sub-Inspector (Excise) at a shop where Kumar worked as a salesman, leading to the seizure of 40 cans of Budweiser non-alcoholic beer and 88 bottles of Budweiser fruit beer, which were found to contain 0.6% v/v ethyl alcohol.

The petitioner argued that non-alcoholic drinks or fruit beers do not fall under the definition of intoxicating drinks as per the Excise Act, and thus the prosecution was misconceived. He highlighted that the product had been tested and certified as non-alcoholic by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and that the alcohol content was marginally above the tolerance limit set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

The court examined the definitions of 'intoxicant' and 'liquor' under the Excise Act and noted that the law allows for a margin of error in alcohol content due to natural variations. The court emphasized that the purpose of the prohibition law is to prevent the sale of intoxicants, and a minor infraction in alcohol content does not warrant prosecution.

The court referenced previous Supreme Court rulings that allow for quashing of FIRs when the allegations do not constitute an offense. Ultimately, the court found that the prosecution against Kumar was not justified, as the seized products were not sold as intoxicants and the minor excess in alcohol content did not violate the intent of the law.

The FIR stemmed from a police raid on November 21, 2020, where it was claimed that Jain was preparing and selling spurious ghee in his godown. During the raid, police seized 27 tins of ghee, which they suspected to be adulterated, along with other cooking materials. However, subsequent analysis by a Food Analyst revealed that the ghee was not adulterated and met the required standards.

The petitioner argued that he was falsely implicated, presenting evidence such as his business registration, licenses, and tax invoices to support his claims. He contended that the FIR was based on a fabricated story and that the proper legal procedures under the Food Safety Act were not followed prior to the FIR's registration. The petitioner also highlighted that the seized items were not properly sealed during the police action.

The State's Public Prosecutor opposed the petition, asserting that there was sufficient evidence to support the charges against Jain.

The specific charges against Salunke were for violations under Section 26(2)(i) and 26(2)(iv) in conjunction with Section 3(1)(xxii), which pertain to food safety regulations. 

The trial court had sentenced Salunke to six months of simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000, with an additional provision that failure to pay the fine would result in an extra month of imprisonment. Following this conviction, Salunke filed an appeal, and the trial court suspended the execution of the imprisonment sentence pending the appeal process.

During the hearing, the court considered the length of the sentence and the likelihood that the appeal would not be heard in the near future. Consequently, the High Court decided to suspend the execution of the substantive sentence of imprisonment while the appeal was pending. The court ordered that Salunke be released upon executing a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 15,000, with a surety of the same amount.

144,Rajesh_Kumar_vs_Union_Of_India_Ors_on_18_February_2022.PDF,"On February 18, 2022, the High Court of Delhi, presided over by Justice V. Kameswar Rao, delivered a judgment in three writ petitions filed by Rajesh Kumar, Pawan Kumar, and Ms. Priyanka Rai against the Union of India and other respondents regarding the issuance of licenses to act as Custom Brokers under the Customs Brokers Licensing Regulations, 2013 (CBLR, 2013). 

The petitioners sought to quash the results of their oral examinations held on May 25, 2019, claiming they had met the required passing marks of 50, as per the regulations in effect at the time of their written examinations. They argued that the subsequent amendment to the regulations (CBLR, 2018) introduced a new cut-off of 60 marks for the oral examination without prior notice, which they contended was unfair and not applicable to their cases since their eligibility was based on the earlier regulations.

The court noted that the petitioners had successfully cleared the written examination held on January 19, 2018, and were entitled to two attempts for the oral examination under CBLR, 2013. However, they failed to qualify in their first attempt in July 2018. The second attempt was conducted under the new CBLR, 2018, which the respondents argued had superseded the previous regulations. The petitioners, however, maintained that they were not informed of the change in the passing criteria before their second oral examination.

The court examined the relevant provisions of both CBLR, 2013 and CBLR, 2018, concluding that the petitioners were entitled to be assessed based on the criteria that were in place when they began their examination process. The court emphasized that changing the criteria midway without proper notice to the candidates was impermissible and would lead to an anomaly in the assessment process.

Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of the petitioners, directing the respondents to issue licenses to them as Custom Brokers, thereby allowing their petitions. The court dismissed any pending applications as infructuous and did not impose any costs on the parties involved.",High Court of Delhi,"['Rajesh Kumar', 'Pawan Kumar', 'Ms. Priyanka Rai']","['Union of India & Ors', 'Directorate General of Performance Management and Ors']",['V.

Case No. 172 of 2021. The case involved allegations under sections 272 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code, as well as Section 48/59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The hearing took place on February 7, 2022, before Justice Anil Kumar Choudhary via video conferencing.

The petitioner was represented by Mr. Kamdeo Pandey, while the State was represented by Mr. P.D. Agrawal, Special Public Prosecutor (Spl. P.P.). During the proceedings, the learned counsel for the petitioner acknowledged the need to rectify certain defects pointed out by the stamp reporter and committed to addressing these issues within two weeks after the court resumed physical operations.

The Special P.P. argued that the offences in question were bailable, specifically noting that the only charge against the petitioner under Section 59(i) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, carried a maximum sentence of six months. Consequently, the Special P.P. contended that the anticipatory bail application was not maintainable since all alleged offences were bailable.

The petitioner’s counsel did not contest this assertion regarding the bailable nature of the offences. After considering the facts and the submissions made, the court concluded that the anticipatory bail application was not maintainable due to the bailable nature of the offences. Therefore, the application was dismissed, as the petitioner failed to demonstrate any apprehension of arrest concerning a non-bailable offence.

**Court:** High Court of Delhi  
**Judges:** Justice Vipin Sanghi, Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma  
**Petitioner:** Ram Gaua Raksha Dal  
**Respondents:** Union of India & Others (including FSSAI)  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and its regulations regarding the labeling of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food products. The petitioner, Ram Gaua Raksha Dal, challenged the adequacy of a communication issued by FSSAI on December 22, 2021, which was intended to clarify the labeling requirements for food products containing animal-derived ingredients.

**Key Points of the Judgement:**  
1. **Regulatory Framework:**  
   - The court referenced the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, which mandates that non-vegetarian food must bear a specific symbol and color code.  
   - It was noted that even if a compound ingredient constitutes less than 5% of the food, the presence of any animal-derived ingredient (excluding certain exceptions like milk) should still classify the food as non-vegetarian.

2. **Petitioner's Argument:**  
   - The petitioner argued that the communication from FSSAI lacked clarity and did not fully address the court's previous order from December 9, 2021.  
   - They contended that the communication failed to require Food Business Operators (FBOs) to disclose all ingredients, including those sourced from animals, regardless of their quantity.

3. **Court's Observations:**  
   - The court agreed that the obligation for FBOs to disclose whether a food product is vegetarian or non-vegetarian is independent of the labeling regulations concerning compound ingredients.  
   - The court emphasized the importance of complete transparency for consumer awareness, citing consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
   - The court noted that the failure to ensure full disclosure undermines the objectives of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which aims to ensure safe and wholesome food for consumers.

4. **Directive to FSSAI:**  
   - The court directed FSSAI to issue a new communication clarifying the obligations of FBOs regarding the disclosure of vegetarian and non-vegetarian status of food products.  
   - It was ordered that this communication should be made public to ensure consumer awareness.

5. **Further Proceedings:**  
   - The court requested the respondents to file detailed counter-affidavits addressing all points raised by the petitioner within four weeks, with rejoinders to be filed subsequently.
   - The court scheduled the next hearing for May 26, 2022.

**Conclusion:**  
The judgement highlighted the necessity for clear and comprehensive labeling of food products to protect consumer rights and ensure informed choices regarding vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. The court's directive aimed to enhance transparency in food labeling practices, reinforcing the regulatory framework established under the Food Safety and Standards Act.",High Court of Delhi,['RAM GAUA RAKSHA DAL'],"['UNION OF INDIA', 'FSSAI']","['VIPIN SANGHI', 'DINESH KUMAR SHARMA']",02-03-2022,['Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)'],['New Delhi'],"['Clause (4) of sub-regulation 2.2.4 of FSS (Packaging & Labelling) Regulations 2011', 'Clause 2(d) of sub-regulation 2.2.2 of FSS (Packaging & Labelling) Regulations 2011', 'Section 3 (y) of FSS Act 2006', 'Section 2 (9) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006', 'Consumer Protection Act, 2019', 'Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940', 'Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011']",['Indian Soaps & Toiletries Makers Association vs. Ozair Husain and Others'],"The case involves a petition by Ram Gau Raksha Dal against the Union of India and FSSAI regarding the clarity and enforcement of regulations concerning the labeling of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food products.

**Judge:** A.D. Jagadish Chandira  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioners:**  
  1. Ravichandran  
  2. Sanjaikumar Agarwal  
  3. Dillibabu  
- **Respondent:**  
  State represented by the Food Safety Officer, Kundrathur Division, Tamilnadu Food Safety and Medicine Administration  

**Background:**  
The petitioners sought to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.183 of 2019 pending before the Judicial Magistrate, Sriperumbudur. The prosecution alleged that the first petitioner, a salesman, along with the second and third petitioners, the owner and nominee of Guptha Bhavan, sold unsafe food items (Babay Laddu) based on a report from the Food Analyst regarding samples taken on 27 November 2018.  

**Key Arguments:**  
- The petitioners argued that the prosecution violated Section 42 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which mandates that the Food Analyst must send the analysis report within 14 days of receiving the sample. In this case, the report was only received by the Designated Officer on 9 April 2019, which was a delay of over four months.  
- The petitioners cited a precedent case (A.Muthukumar v. Chidambaram) where similar delays led to the quashing of proceedings, arguing that the delay in their case also rendered the proceedings invalid.  
- The Additional Public Prosecutor acknowledged the delay but maintained that the sample was sent for analysis on the same day it was taken.  

**Court's Findings:**  
- The court examined Section 42(2) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, which clearly states the requirement for timely reporting by the Food Analyst. The court noted that the significant delay in receiving the report (over four months) undermined the validity of the prosecution's case.  
- The court referenced the precedent case, emphasizing that procedural lapses at the fundamental level of food sample analysis could invalidate the entire proceedings.  

**Decision:**  
The court concluded that the proceedings in C.C.No.183 of 2019 were vitiated due to the procedural lapses and thus quashed the proceedings. The connected miscellaneous petition was also closed.

The judgement highlighted the importance of adhering to procedural timelines in food safety regulations, reinforcing that delays can significantly impact the validity of legal proceedings in food safety cases.",High Court of Judicature at Madras,"['Ravichandran', 'Sanjaikumar Agarwal', 'Dillibabu']","['State rep. by The Food Safety Officer, Kundrathur Division, Tamilnadu Food Safety and Medicine Administration']",['A.D.Jagadish Chandira'],15-02-2022,['Tamilnadu Food Safety and Medicine Administration'],"['Kancheepuram', 'Tamilnadu']","['Section 42 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']",['A.Muthukumar v.

He also sought a complete ban on chewing tobacco and other tobacco products packaged in sachets or pouches.  
  
**Previous Orders:**  
On 25 February 2022, the court noted an order from the Commissioner of Food Safety, Bihar, which had already prohibited the manufacture, storage, distribution, transportation, display, or sale of any type of Gutkha and Pan Masala containing tobacco and/or nicotine within the state.  
  
**Court Proceedings:**  
During the hearing on 25 March 2022, the petitioner acknowledged the existing prohibition and indicated that he would approach the competent authority under the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Regulations, 2011, and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, to address any remaining grievances.

The petitioner had imported Split Cassia, Spring Star Aniseed, and Broken Spring Star Aniseed, but only the Split Cassia was cleared by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The other items failed mandatory tests and were detained at the CFS for nine months, leading to a diminishing value of the goods. The petitioner requested a waiver of warehouse charges due to the prolonged detention, but this was declined by the respondents, leading to the current writ petition.

The respondents, including the Union of India and the Container Corporation of India, argued that the charges were calculated according to the applicable tariff for the CFS at Vallarpadam, which is based on the geographical location and the volume of business at the terminal. They stated that since the cargo did not comply with FSSAI regulations, it could not be auctioned or sold in India and had to be re-exported, resulting in accrued charges of ₹19,12,556 (including GST).

The court noted that the petitioner did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the charges were excessive or unreasonable. It acknowledged that the respondents were compelled to store the cargo due to its non-compliance with FSSAI standards and found no illegality or arbitrariness in the actions of the respondents.

The petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Sudipta Sarkar, along with Mr. S. Basu and Mr. S.

Gharote, addressed two criminal applications on March 1, 2022. The first application (BA No. 126 of 2022) involved Salman Abdul Sheikh, who was charged with multiple offenses under the Indian Penal Code (Sections 188, 272, 273, and 328) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (Sections 30(2)(a), 26(2)(iv), 27(2)(e), and 59). The second application (BA No. 127 of 2022) was withdrawn by the applicant Mohd. Yasin s/o Mohd. Ilyas Ansari, as the court was not inclined to accept it on merits.

The incident in question occurred on January 21, 2021, at approximately 1:00 a.m., leading to Sheikh's arrest on the same day. His counsel, Mr. Anil Mardikar, argued that Sheikh had no prior criminal record and was merely assisting co-accused Mohd. Yasin and Jaid Illisa Ansari by holding gunny bags, without knowledge of their contents. He emphasized that Sheikh was employed at a private hospital and requested bail based on his lack of involvement in the crime.

The State, represented by Mr. A. R. Chutke, acknowledged that Sheikh had no criminal antecedents and was only carrying the bags on a motorcycle. However, the State opposed bail, citing ongoing investigations. Despite this, the court noted that the case diary did not indicate any prima facie involvement of Sheikh, supported by statements from the seller and co-accused, which suggested his limited role.

Ultimately, the court granted bail to Salman Abdul Sheikh, allowing his release on the condition of a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two solvent sureties of the same amount. Additional conditions included not tampering with witnesses, not committing similar offenses, and reporting to the police station twice a week.

**Background:**  
The applicant, Sampat Bhagwan Nanawanre, sought anticipatory bail in connection with an investigation into Crime No. 557/2021 at Police Station Baramati, Pune Rural. The charges against him included various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) related to adulteration and fraud, as well as multiple sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The allegations specifically involved the adulteration of milk with Nirma Powder and other detergents.

**Court's Decision:**  
The court granted anticipatory bail to Sampat Bhagwan Nanawanre under the following conditions:  
1. In the event of his arrest, he would be released on executing a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties of the same amount.

The charges against him included violations of various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, specifically concerning the illegal possession of banned Panmasala/Guthka products. 

The complaint was lodged by Ms. Pradnya Surase, the Additional Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Department in Solapur, following a raid in Relekar's agricultural field where the banned products were discovered. 

During the hearing, the applicant's counsel argued that Section 328 of the IPC, which is non-bailable, was the only serious charge against Relekar, while the other charges were bailable. Furthermore, it was noted that the applicability of Section 328 in similar cases was under consideration by the Supreme Court, which had granted interim protection in related petitions. 

The Additional Public Prosecutor requested additional time to respond to the application. 

The court, presided over by Justice C.V. Bhadang, granted anticipatory bail to Relekar under specific conditions: 
1. If arrested, he would be released on a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties of the same amount.

**Date:** 27 January 2022  
**Judges:** Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Nirzar S. Desai  
**Case Number:** R/SCR.A/3419/2020  

**Background:**  
The petitioner, Sapna Gehlot, sought a writ of habeas corpus to recover her three minor children from the custody of her husband, Devendra Singh Gehlot, and his family members. The children, Leon Gillian Singh Gehlot, Paurush Singh Gehlot, and Thaarun Singh Gehlot, are citizens of New Zealand, and the petitioner is a permanent resident there. The case arose after the father allegedly unlawfully retained the children in India against a guardianship order from the New Zealand High Court.  

**Factual Matrix:**  
1. **Marriage and Children:** Sapna married Devendra in 2010, and they had three children in New Zealand.  
2. **Travel to India:** In 2015, Sapna was sent to India for a family wedding but was denied the opportunity to return to New Zealand with her children.  
3. **Custody Dispute:** In 2017, Devendra took the children to India under false pretenses and subsequently refused to return them, leading to a custody battle.  
4. **Legal Proceedings in New Zealand:** The New Zealand High Court ruled in favor of Sapna, ordering the return of the children to New Zealand, citing their unlawful retention in India.  
5. **Attempts to Contact Children:** Sapna faced significant barriers in contacting her children, including being denied visits and communication.  
6. **Legal Actions in India:** Sapna filed a habeas corpus petition in the Gujarat High Court after exhausting other legal remedies.  

**Arguments:**  
- **Petitioner's Argument:** Sapna argued that the children's removal from New Zealand was illegal and that their best interests required their return to her custody in New Zealand.  
- **Respondent's Argument:** Devendra contended that he had lawful custody as their biological father and raised objections regarding the maintainability of the petition, citing ongoing divorce and custody proceedings in India.  

**Court's Findings:**  
1. The court emphasized the importance of the children's welfare and the need to respect the New Zealand High Court's orders.  
2. It found that the children had been unlawfully retained in India and that their best interests would be served by returning them to their mother in New Zealand.  
3. The court rejected the respondent's claims of lawful custody, noting the mother's natural guardianship rights.  
4. The court highlighted the father's obstructive behavior in denying the mother access to her children and the detrimental impact on the children's well-being.  

**Final Decision:**  
The court ordered that the custody of all three children be handed over to Sapna Gehlot. Devendra was directed to make arrangements for their return to New Zealand within eight weeks, including travel logistics. The court also mandated that the children should be allowed to maintain contact with their father through video calls.  

**Conclusion:**  
The judgment underscored the paramount importance of the children's welfare and the need for compliance with international custody orders, reinforcing the mother's rights as the natural guardian.",High Court of Gujarat,['Sapna Gehlot W/O Devendra Singh Gehlot'],"['State Of Gujarat', 'Devendra Singh Gehlot', 'Laxmiben Gehlot', 'Vinita Gehlot']","['Sonia Gokani', 'Nirzar S.

Bhadang, addressed an anticipatory bail application filed by the applicant, Sarfrazaddin Mohammad Yunus Shaikh, on February 8, 2022. The applicant was apprehending arrest in connection with Crime No.34 of 2022, investigated by the Hadapsar Police Station in Pune. The charges against him included serious offenses under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) such as 272 (adulteration of food or drink), 273 (sale of noxious food or drink), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), and others, as well as violations of the Food Safety and Standards Act.

The prosecution's case was based on the transportation of banned gutkha and pan masala in a truck owned by the applicant. The driver of the truck, Samiullah Murtaja Hussain, was interrogated, revealing that the vehicle belonged to the applicant, which led to the investigation.

The applicant's counsel argued that the key non-bailable charge, Section 328 of the IPC, was not applicable as there was no evidence of an attempt to administer any intoxicant or stupefying substance with the intent to commit an offense. The counsel referenced a Supreme Court decision (Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs. State of Kerala) and a prior order from the Aurangabad Bench, which suggested that Section 328 may not apply in similar circumstances. However, a conflicting view had been taken by a different bench in Mumbai, which was under challenge in the Supreme Court, where interim protection had been granted to the petitioner.

The Additional Public Prosecutor contended that there was substantial evidence of the banned products being transported, necessitating the applicant's custody for further investigation.

The court noted the conflicting views on the applicability of Section 328 and decided to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant. The order stipulated that in the event of arrest, the applicant would be released on bail upon executing a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two solvent sureties of the same amount. Additionally, the applicant was required to report to the Investigating Officer on specified dates and cooperate with the investigation, ensuring not to tamper with evidence or witnesses.

**Key Parties:**  
- **Applicant:** Satish Murari Lal Sharma  
- **Respondent:** The State of Maharashtra  
  
**Background:**  
The case revolves around an anticipatory bail application filed by Satish Murari Lal Sharma in connection with a criminal case involving the possession of banned articles, specifically Gutkha and Pan Masala. The applicant was implicated based on a statement made by one of the co-accused, Tavef Kallu Shaikh, who claimed to have procured the banned items from Sharma.  
  
**Arguments Presented:**  
1. **Opposition to Bail:** The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) opposed the bail application, arguing that the applicant's involvement was evident from the First Information Report (FIR) and that the matter was being presented for the first time, with the prosecution still needing to review the case papers.  
2. **Lack of Evidence:** The court noted that while the police had ample time to gather evidence linking Sharma to the seized items (from 4th November 2021 to 13th January 2022), no substantial evidence was presented to the Additional Sessions Judge during the previous hearings.  
3. **Need for Protection:** Given the lack of further action by the police against Sharma after his name was revealed, the court found it reasonable to grant him protection until the case papers could be reviewed.  
  
**Court's Decision:**  
- The court issued a notice to the respondent (State of Maharashtra), returnable on 8th April 2022.  
- In the interim, the court granted anticipatory bail to Sharma, stipulating that in the event of his arrest in connection with Crime No. 430 of 2021, he would be released on a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with two solvent sureties of Rs. 15,000 each.  
- The court imposed conditions on Sharma, including:  
  - He must not engage in any criminal activity or tamper with evidence.  
  - He is required to cooperate with the investigation and report to the Investigation Officer every Sunday between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. until further orders.

The applicants were apprehending arrest based on allegations that they were involved in the transportation of banned Gutka/Tobacco products, following the arrest of a co-accused, Noorkhan Pathan, who was caught in the act. 

The applicants' counsel argued that the First Information Report (FIR) did not mention the applicants' names or attribute any specific role to them in the crime. They contended that the police's basis for wanting to arrest the applicants was solely the statement of the co-accused, which lacked evidentiary value. The prosecution, represented by the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor (APP), countered that the involvement of the applicants was indicated by the co-accused's confession, and that their arrest was necessary to investigate the public health implications of the banned products.

The court noted the conflicting legal precedents regarding the applicability of Section 328 of the IPC in cases involving banned substances like Gutka. It acknowledged that while some decisions indicated that such charges could not be substantiated, others supported the prosecution's stance. Ultimately, the court found that there was insufficient material to connect the applicants directly to the crime, as their names were not in the FIR and no specific role was attributed to them.

The court concluded that the custodial interrogation of the applicants was not necessary for the investigation, and thus, the interim protection previously granted was confirmed.

The case arose from a police raid where co-accused Parmeshwar Vibhute was caught transporting banned Gutka/Tobacco products. During interrogation, Vibhute allegedly named Gadewar as the source of the banned items.

The applicant's counsel argued that the FIR did not mention Gadewar's name and that there was no direct evidence linking him to the crime, asserting that custodial interrogation was unnecessary. The prosecution, represented by the Assistant Public Prosecutor (APP), countered that the co-accused's statement indicated Gadewar's involvement in the distribution of hazardous goods, which posed a public health risk.

The court noted that while Section 328 of the IPC could be applicable, the evidentiary value of the co-accused's statement was weak, as it was the only basis for the police's interest in arresting Gadewar.

The charges against him include violations under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 272 (adulteration of food or drink), Section 273 (sale of noxious food or drink), Section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), all read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Section 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.  
  
**Arguments Presented:**  
1. **For the Applicant:**  
   - The applicant's advocate, Mr. B. N. Gadegaonkar, argued for the grant of anticipatory bail, emphasizing that the FIR does not mention the applicant's name directly. Instead, it appears that his name was disclosed by a co-accused.  
   - The advocate contended that the role attributed to the applicant needs to be examined further, and until the papers are reviewed, the applicant's liberty should not be curtailed.  
  
2. **For the Respondent-State:**  
   - The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP), Mr. B. V. Virdhe, strongly opposed the grant of bail, citing that the matter was being presented for the first time and that he had not yet received the necessary papers.  
   - The APP highlighted that significant quantities of banned articles were found with the co-accused, suggesting that the applicant should not be shown sympathy given the serious nature of the allegations.  
  
**Court's Decision:**  
- The court acknowledged the arguments from both sides and noted that the applicant's name was not initially included in the FIR.  
- The court decided to issue a notice to the respondent-State and scheduled the next hearing for 14 March 2022.  
- In the interim, the court granted anticipatory bail to Shankar Govind Gadewar, stipulating that in the event of his arrest, he should be released on a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with two solvent sureties of Rs. 15,000 each.  
- Additionally, the applicant was ordered to attend the Mukhed Police Station every Wednesday and Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. until further orders.  
  
**Conclusion:**  
The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail reflects its consideration of the applicant's rights and the lack of direct evidence against him in the FIR, while also ensuring that he remains available for police inquiries.",HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY,['Shankar Govind Gadewar'],['The State Of Maharashtra'],['Vibha Kankanwadi'],24-02-2022,[],"['Maharashtra', 'Nanded']","['Section 188 of IPC', 'Section 272 of IPC', 'Section 273 of IPC', 'Section 328 of IPC', 'Section 34 of IPC', 'Section 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']","['Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006']",[],The applicant's name was not in the FIR and was disclosed by a co-accused.

The petitions sought to quash two First Information Reports (F.I.Rs) registered against the petitioners at the Macherla Town Police Station in Guntur District. 

The F.I.Rs in question were registered for various offences, including those under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection), 273 (sale of noxious food or drink), 420 (cheating), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), as well as under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act) Sections 56 (penalty for unsafe food), 57 (penalty for misbranding), and 63 (penalty for contravention of provisions). 

During the hearing, the court noted that the matters were covered by previous orders in similar cases, specifically referencing Criminal Petition No. 5421 of 2019 and Criminal Petition No. 2966 of 2021, where the court had quashed several F.I.Rs based on identical facts. The petitioners in the current case were deemed to be similarly situated to those in the earlier cases. 

Consequently, the court allowed the petitions and quashed the F.I.Rs registered against the petitioners, thereby providing them relief from the charges. The court also ordered that any pending miscellaneous petitions related to these Criminal Petitions would stand closed.

165,Sheikh_Salim_Sheikh_Gafur_And_Another_vs_State_Of_Mah_Thr_Pso_Ps_Parwa_on_5_January_2022.PDF,"In the case of Sheikh Salim Sheikh Gafur and Another vs. State of Maharashtra, the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, addressed a criminal application for pre-arrest bail filed by the applicants Sheikh Salim Sheikh Gafur and Sheikh Mahebub. The application was heard by Justice Vinay Joshi on January 5, 2022.

The applicants sought protection from arrest in connection with Crime No. 488/2021, which was registered at the Parwa Railway Police Station in Yavatmal. The charges against them included violations of the Indian Penal Code (Sections 188, 272, 273, 328) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (Sections 26[2][i], 27[2][e], 30[2][a], and 59). The prosecution's case was based on a police operation that intercepted a truck carrying a large quantity of Gutka, a prohibited contraband item, valued at approximately Rs. 10,88,400.

The police had received secret information leading to the seizure of the Gutka, and during the investigation, it was revealed that Sheikh Salim was the owner of the truck, while Sheikh Mahebub was implicated as the individual responsible for transporting the contraband. The State opposed the bail application, arguing that statements recorded during the investigation indicated the complicity of the applicants. The police also presented call detail records (CDR) to demonstrate the applicants' involvement in the crime, and highlighted that both had prior offenses related to similar activities.

The court noted the significant quantity of the prohibited articles seized and the established connection of the applicants to the offense. It emphasized that the arrested individuals (the driver and cleaner) were merely handlers, while the applicants had a more substantial role. The court expressed concern over the ongoing illegal transportation of Gutka despite a long-standing ban, indicating that the offense posed a threat to society as a whole.

Ultimately, the court concluded that a thorough investigation was necessary and found it inappropriate to grant pre-arrest protection to the applicants. Therefore, the criminal application for bail was rejected.","High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench","['Sheikh Salim Sheikh Gafur', 'Sheikh Mahebub']","['State of Maharashtra, through P.S.

**Court:** High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru  
**Judges:** G. Narendar, M.G.S. Kamal  
**Writ Petitions:** 6901 of 2021 (S-KSAT) and 13528 of 2020 (S-KSAT)  

**Key Parties:**  
- **Petitioners:**  
  1. H.N. Sathish, Food Safety Officer, Mysore  
  2. Shiva Kumar, Hubli-Dharwad Mahanagara Palike  
- **Respondents:**  
  1. The State of Karnataka, represented by the Principal Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare  
  2. The Commissioner for Food Safety and Standard Authority  
  3. Dr. Deepak Kumar Sukke, Designated Officer of Food Safety and Standard, Hubli-Dharwad  

**Background:**  
The petitioners, who were appointed as Food Safety Officers in 2003, challenged a notification dated 24.01.2017 that appointed 36 district-level officers as Designated Officers. They argued that this appointment was contrary to the Health and Family Welfare Service (Food Safety and Standard Department) (Recruitment) Rules, 2015, which stipulated that 50% of Designated Officers should be filled by direct recruitment and 50% by promotion from the cadre of Senior Food Safety Officers. The petitioners contended that the notification violated previous court orders and the established recruitment rules.

**Tribunal's Decision:**  
The Karnataka Administrative Tribunal dismissed the applications of the petitioners on 02.11.2020, stating that the notification was issued in the public interest due to a shortage of enforcement authorities and was an adhoc arrangement until the recruitment rules could be fully implemented. The Tribunal noted that the petitioners' status, salary, and promotional prospects were not adversely affected by the notification.

**Arguments:**  
- **For the Petitioners:**  
  - The notification was against the established recruitment rules and previous court judgments.  
  - The appointment of Medical Officers as Designated Officers was inappropriate and not in line with the rules.  

- **For the Respondents:**  
  - The notification was necessary for public health and was an interim measure due to staffing shortages.  
  - The arrangement did not affect the petitioners' positions or rights.

**Court's Findings:**  
The High Court reviewed the Tribunal's decision and found that the notification was indeed an adhoc measure aimed at addressing immediate staffing needs. The Court noted that the petitioners' roles and salaries were not impacted by the notification. The Court emphasized the need for the State to adhere to the statutory provisions and recruitment rules in future appointments.

**Final Decision:**  
The High Court dismissed the writ petitions, agreeing with the Tribunal's assessment that the notification was justified in the public interest and did not infringe upon the petitioners' rights. The Court urged the State to fill positions in accordance with the statutory provisions and recruitment rules moving forward.",HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU,"['H.N.

167,Shivraj_Irappa_Chinchol_vs_The_State_Of_Maharashtra_on_24_March_2022.PDF,"In the case of Shivraj Irappa Chinchol vs The State of Maharashtra, the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, presided by Justice C.V. Bhadang, addressed an anticipatory bail application filed by the applicant, Shivraj Irappa Chinchol, on March 24, 2022. The applicant was apprehending arrest in connection with Crime No. 502/2021, which involved allegations of selling adulterated fruit beer, violating several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

The complaint against Chinchol was lodged by Renuka Ramesh Patil from the Foods and Drugs Department, following a raid on August 25, 2021, where both Chinchol and co-accused Amarsiddha Pindipol were found selling fruit beer. Samples of the product were sent for analysis, which confirmed that the fruit beer was adulterated and unsafe for consumption.

The applicant's counsel argued that the only non-bailable section invoked was Section 328 of the IPC, which pertains to administering substances with the intent to commit an offense. The counsel referenced a Supreme Court decision (Joseph Kurian & Anr. Vs. State of Kerala) to support the argument that Section 328 may not apply, as there was no evidence of intent to administer a harmful substance. The counsel also noted that a warrant had been issued against the applicant, but argued that anticipatory bail could still be granted, citing precedents where bail was allowed even after a warrant was issued.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) contended that the issuance of a warrant rendered the anticipatory bail application incompetent. However, the court noted that there was no proclamation against the applicant declaring him a proclaimed offender, which would have affected the maintainability of the bail application.

Ultimately, the court granted anticipatory bail to Shivraj Irappa Chinchol under specific conditions: he was to be released on a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with solvent sureties, report to the Investigating Officer on specified dates, cooperate with the investigation, and refrain from tampering with evidence or witnesses.

The petitioners, represented by Mr. Mayank Gupta, argued that the complaint was based on a report (Annexure-10) which indicated that the second RFL (Referral Food Laboratory) report was received on June 16, 2014, after the product in question had already expired. The product was manufactured in January 2013 and had a shelf life of nine months, thus it was no longer viable by the time the report was issued.

The case arose from a road traffic accident that occurred on 02 February 2019, where the petitioner, Sh. Ram Avtar, sustained grievous injuries after being struck by a motorcycle driven by Shivam. The accident took place while Ram Avtar was crossing the road towards G.B. Pant Hospital. The motorcycle was reportedly being driven rashly and negligently, with two pillion riders.

- The respondents, Shivam and Shankar, did not file a written statement despite being given opportunities.  
- The insurance company, ICICI Lombard, acknowledged the vehicle was insured but contested liability, citing that Shivam did not possess a valid driving license at the time of the accident.  

**Issues:**

2. Whether Ram Avtar is entitled to compensation, and if so, the amount and from whom.

**Findings:**  
- The court found that Ram Avtar did suffer grievous injuries due to the negligent driving of Shivam.  
- It was established that Shivam was driving without a valid license, which contributed to the accident.  
- The court noted that while Ram Avtar was also somewhat negligent (contributory negligence), this did not absolve Shivam of his responsibility.  

**Compensation Awarded:**  
- Total compensation calculated was Rs. 3,30,845.  
- After deducting 15% for contributory negligence, the final amount awarded was Rs. 2,81,500.  
- The compensation included medical expenses, conveyance, special diet, and loss of income for two months.  
- Interest at 6% per annum was awarded from the date of filing the DAR until realization.  

**Liability:**  
- The court held that all respondents (Shivam, Shankar, and ICICI Lombard) were jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation.  
- The insurance company was entitled to recover the amount from Shivam and Shankar after satisfying the award.  

**Conclusion:**  
The court directed ICICI Lombard to deposit the awarded amount with interest within 30 days, failing which a higher interest rate would apply.

  1. Smt. C. Kavitha (Wife)  
  2. Master Yajath S (Son, represented by Smt. Kavitha)  
- **Respondent:** Sri. Sivanesan P (Husband)  

**Background:**  
The appeal was filed by Smt. C. Kavitha and her son against the order dated 20.03.2019 of the Metropolitan Traffic Court-III, Bengaluru, which dismissed their petition under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, and Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for maintenance. The appellants sought monthly maintenance of Rs. 8,000 for Smt. Kavitha and Rs. 7,000 for her son, alleging domestic violence and neglect by the respondent, who is employed in the police department with a monthly salary of Rs. 45,250.

**Key Arguments:**  
- **Appellants' Claims:**  
  - Smt. Kavitha claimed she was subjected to mental and physical cruelty by the respondent, who had deserted them and failed to provide maintenance despite having a stable income.  
  - She argued that the respondent's actions caused her significant mental anguish and financial hardship, especially after he filed a custody case against her.  

- **Respondent's Defense:**  
  - The respondent denied all allegations of cruelty and neglect, claiming that Smt. Kavitha had voluntarily left their home and that he had provided for their son’s education.  
  - He argued that Smt. Kavitha was mentally ill and that he had taken her for treatment, which she denied.  

**Trial Court's Findings:**  
The trial court dismissed the petition, concluding that Smt. Kavitha had deserted the respondent and was capable of maintaining herself, thus not entitled to maintenance. The court also noted that she had not taken legal action against the respondent for several years, which it interpreted as a lack of urgency in her claims.

**Appeal Court's Analysis:**  
The appeal court found that the trial court had erred in its conclusions. It noted that:  
- The respondent failed to provide any medical evidence to support his claims about Smt. Kavitha's mental health.  
- The trial court's assertion that Smt. Kavitha had voluntarily deserted the respondent was unfounded, as she had sought legal remedies to restore their relationship.  
- The respondent had not demonstrated that he had made adequate arrangements for the maintenance of his wife and son, which constituted economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.  

**Final Decision:**  
The appeal was allowed, and the trial court's order was set aside. The respondent was directed to pay monthly maintenance of Rs. 8,000 to Smt. Kavitha and Rs. 7,000 to Master Yajath, effective from the date of the original petition. The court emphasized the respondent's legal obligation to support his family and recognized the ongoing nature of domestic violence claims.","LII Addl.

**Court:** Ms. Snigdha Sarvaria, ACJ-cum-CCJ-cum-ARC, Shahdara District, Karkardooma Courts, Delhi.
**Case Number:** RC ARC No: 237/2019  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioner:** Smt. Nipun Kochhar, wife of late Sh. Tushar Kochhar  
- **Respondent:** Sh. Balkishan  

**Background:**  
The petitioner, Smt. Nipun Kochhar, sought eviction of the respondent, Sh. Balkishan, from a shop located at property no. 2/76, Arjun Gali, Vishwas Nagar, Shahdara, Delhi, under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, claiming a bona fide requirement for her son to start a grocery business. The tenancy was originally created by the late Smt. Maya Devi in 1982, and after her death, the property was inherited by her son, Sh. Madan Lal Kochhar, and subsequently by the petitioner and her sister-in-law.

**Petitioner's Claims:**  
1. The petitioner claimed that she and her family were facing financial difficulties, relying on rental income and interest from fixed deposits, totaling approximately Rs. 17,000 per month, which was insufficient to cover their monthly expenses of around Rs. 41,750.
2. She expressed a need to open a grocery shop for her son, Master Tarun Kochhar, aged 17, to ensure a stable income for the family.
3. The petitioner stated that she had repeatedly requested the respondent to vacate the premises, but he refused.

**Respondent's Defense:**  
1. The respondent contested the eviction, arguing that the petitioner had not provided original documents to support her claims and that the eviction petition was not maintainable.
2. He claimed that there were three shops in the property, not two, and that the petitioner had concealed this fact.
3. The respondent asserted that the petitioner was financially stable, living a luxurious life, and had no genuine need for the shop.
4. He also questioned the ability of the petitioner's son to run a business due to his age and lack of experience.

**Court's Analysis:**  
1. The court emphasized that the burden of proof lies with the landlord to establish a bona fide requirement for eviction. The petitioner must show that the need is genuine and not merely a desire.
2. The court noted that the relationship of landlord and tenant was established, as the respondent had been paying rent to the petitioner.
3. The court found that the petitioner had a legitimate need for the shop for her son’s business, which was supported by the financial difficulties she faced.
4. The court rejected the respondent's claims regarding the petitioner's financial status, stating that mere assertions without evidence were insufficient to counter the petitioner's claims.
5. The court also ruled that the age of the petitioner's son did not preclude him from running a grocery store, and the need for the shop was genuine.
6. The court dismissed the respondent's application for leave to defend, stating that no triable issues were raised that would prevent the eviction.

**Final Decision:**  
The court allowed the petition for eviction under Section 14(1)(e) of the DRC Act, ordering the eviction of the respondent from the tenanted premises.

  4. Designated Officer, Food Safety and Drug Administration Department, Salem District  

**Background:**  
The petitioner, Sri Balamurugan Sago Industries, filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking a Writ of Mandamus. The petition aimed to compel the second respondent (Commissioner of Food Safety) to consider an appeal dated 18.06.2018, which challenged an improvement notice issued by the third respondent (Designated Officer, Namakkal District) on 04.05.2018. The petitioner argued that the notice was unjust and sought to ensure that the implementation of the Food Safety and Standards Act was conducted impartially, without facilitating monopolistic practices in the Sago manufacturing industry.  

**Arguments:**  
- The petitioner contended that the appeal had not been adequately addressed and that the actions of the third and fourth respondents were biased against them.  
- The respondents, represented by the Special Government Pleader, countered that all officers were acting impartially and that the appeal had been disposed of.  

**Court's Findings:**  
1. The court noted that the appeal dated 18.06.2018 had been disposed of, rendering the first part of the petition moot.  
2. Regarding the second part of the petition, the court acknowledged the petitioner's concerns about impartiality but found no merit in issuing further directions, as the respondents were expected to act fairly towards all parties.

- **Respondents:**  
  1. Sri K. Raghupathi

**Background:**  
The appeal was filed by the claimant, Sri K. Gangadhar, challenging the judgment and award dated 13.11.2018 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in MVC No.7066/2016. The claimant sought enhancement of the compensation awarded, arguing that it was inadequate given the severity of his injuries and the impact on his earning capacity.  

**Incident Details:**  
On 21 February 2016, while standing by the roadside near NH-69, the claimant was struck by a lorry driven recklessly, resulting in multiple grievous injuries. He underwent surgery for fractures and was hospitalized for 32 days. The police registered a case against the driver for negligence.  

**Claimant's Arguments:**  
- The tribunal awarded a compensation of Rs.4,46,521/- which the claimant argued was insufficient.  
- The tribunal did not account for loss of income during the recovery period, despite the claimant being unable to work for an extended time.  
- The tribunal assessed the claimant's disability at 15%, while the treating doctor assessed it at 21%.  
- The claimant's monthly income was assessed at Rs.9,000/- instead of the claimed Rs.20,000/-.  

**Respondent's Arguments:**  
- The insurance company contended that the tribunal's award was justified based on the evidence presented.  
- They argued that the claimant had not provided sufficient proof of his income and that the compensation awarded was reasonable.  

**Court's Findings:**  
- The court found that the driver of the lorry was indeed negligent, as supported by police records.  
- The court agreed that the income assessed by the tribunal was low and adjusted it to Rs.9,500/- per month based on the notional income chart for 2016.  
- The court accepted the doctor's assessment of the claimant's disability at 21% and recalculated the loss of future earning capacity accordingly.  
- The court also increased compensation for various heads, including pain and suffering, loss of income during the laid-up period, future medical expenses, and loss of amenities.  

**Final Decision:**  
- The appeal was allowed in part, and the total compensation was modified to Rs.6,63,101/- from the original Rs.4,46,521/-.  
- The insurer was ordered to pay the enhanced compensation within six weeks, failing which interest would accrue at 9%.  
- The claimant was not entitled to interest on future medical expenses and for a delayed period of 315 days.

Sareen, delivered a judgment on March 9, 2022. The case originated from a Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 21745 of 2021, which was filed in conjunction with Criminal Appeal No. 1909 of 2021. 

The matter at hand was an appeal by the State of Gujarat challenging the acquittal of Ramsinh Durgsinh Rajpurohit by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Navsari at Gandevi. The acquittal was based on a judgment dated December 31, 2019, in Criminal Case No. 1395 of 2016, where the respondent was found not guilty of violating several provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, specifically Sections 26(1), 26(2)(I), 26(2)(5), 27, and 59, as well as Regulation No. 2.12.(1)(2) of the Food Product Standard & Food Additives, 2011.

During the hearing, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) for the appellant-State presented the case, while it was noted that the respondent did not appear in court despite being served with notice and given an opportunity to respond. The court, upon reviewing the trial court's judgment, found that the appeal warranted consideration. Consequently, the application for leave to appeal was granted, and the rule was made absolute.

Furthermore, the court admitted the appeal and ordered the registry to issue a bailable warrant for Rs. 5,000 against the respondent, Ramsinh Durgsinh Rajpurohit.

This case arose from a Criminal Miscellaneous Application (R/CR.MA/20470/2021) filed by the State of Gujarat seeking leave to appeal against a judgment of acquittal delivered on March 23, 2021, by the Judicial Magistrate First Class in Junagadh. The acquittal pertained to the respondent, Dilip Dulabhai Thavani, who was accused of violating several provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, specifically Sections 3(1)(ZZ)(IV)(VII)(VIII) and Section 26(2)(I)(II), 59(I). 

During the proceedings, Mr. H.K. Patel, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) for the State, presented arguments in favor of the application for leave to appeal. The court noted that no representation was made by the respondent in this application. After considering the submissions and reviewing the material on record, the court found that the case warranted further examination. Consequently, the application for leave to appeal was granted, allowing the State to challenge the acquittal. 

In the subsequent Criminal Appeal (R/CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1744 of 2021), the court admitted the appeal, with Mr. Ashish Dagli waiving the service of notice on behalf of the respondent. The court also directed the registry to include Mr. Dagli's name as the advocate for the respondent in the appeal.

The petitioners, represented by Senior Advocate Mr. Rahul Pant and Advocate Mr. Dhruv Pant, argued that the prosecution against them was initiated under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. They contended that this prosecution is invalid due to Section 89 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which provides that the latter Act has an overriding effect over all other food-related laws. 

In response, Mr. Amit Gupta, the Additional Advocate General (AAG) representing the respondents, countered the petitioners' claims. He argued that the prosecution under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, was valid and legally sound, citing Section 97 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. This section indicates that the enactments specified in the second schedule of the Act were repealed upon the Act's enactment and enforcement.

The court acknowledged the differing interpretations of the relevant sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and granted both parties an adjournment to further address the court on the matter, scheduling the next hearing for April 18, 2022.

The petitioner argued that the seal should be removed following the quashing of an FIR (Crime No. 167 of 2019) by this Court, which had been registered against the tenants of the petitioner for various offenses, including violations under the Food Safety and Standards Act.

The background of the case involved the Lalapet police seizing certain machinery and sealing the godown as part of their investigation into the FIR against the tenants. However, after the FIR was quashed by the Court in a separate criminal petition, the petitioner contended that the police had failed to remove the seal and unlock the godown, despite his ownership of the property being undisputed.

During the proceedings, the learned Assistant Government Pleader for Home indicated that the police had not received any claims regarding the property from the owner, which was why the possession had not been returned. However, he confirmed that the police were prepared to return possession to the owner upon request, given that the FIR had been quashed.

Ultimately, Justice Cheekati Manavendranath Roy disposed of the Writ Petition with a directive to respondent 3 to remove the seal and unlock the godown that had been seized.

The applicant was facing allegations under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, primarily based on the testimony of a main accused, Salim Bhagwan, who had been arrested and named Singh as his supplier of contraband items.

The prosecution's case stemmed from a raid conducted on October 29, 2021, at a godown in Ulhasnagar, where prohibited substances such as tobacco and gutka were discovered. Following this, Salim Bhagwan was arrested, and his connection to Singh was established through alleged telephonic communications. The Investigating Officer argued against granting bail, suggesting that Singh's ownership of multiple pan kiosks implied he might possess more contraband, thus necessitating custodial interrogation.

However, the court found the prosecution's evidence to be insufficient, noting that the Investigating Officer could not provide concrete material to substantiate the claim that Singh was a stockist of the contraband. Singh's counsel argued that he was a 29-year-old IT professional with no direct involvement in the case and expressed his willingness to cooperate with the investigation.

In its ruling, the court granted anticipatory bail to Sushant Sunil Singh, stipulating that he would be released on a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and required to provide one or two sureties of the same amount.

Shrivastava, challenged the inaction of the State authorities regarding his employment as a Food Safety Officer in Bhopal. The petitioner was aggrieved by the failure of the respondents to comply with an earlier order dated January 22, 2018, which had allowed him to work in that capacity until a new order was issued by the Designated Officer of the Food Safety Administration in Bhopal. Despite multiple representations made by the petitioner requesting permission to work, he was not allowed to do so.

The respondents, represented by learned counsel, opposed the petition, arguing that the petitioner was ineligible for the position of Food Safety Officer due to a lack of authority under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. They indicated that a review application regarding the January 22, 2018 order was pending, which meant that the order had not attained finality and could not be implemented.

The court, presided over by Justice Sushrut Arvind Dharmadhikari, noted that there is no provision for review under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and acknowledged that the order from January 22, 2018, was still in effect. Consequently, the court directed the relevant respondent to implement the order within four weeks from the receipt of the certified copy of the judgment.

The petitioner argued that the water supplied to his hotel was not potable and did not meet Food Safety Standards, leading to adverse experiences with water suppliers who extracted and transported groundwater without proper authorization.

The court, presided over by Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly, noted that the petitioner’s claims were based on personal grievances related to his business, as he did not provide specific details about the water suppliers or supporting documents to substantiate his claims. The petitioner referenced a letter from a Member of the Legislative Assembly and a news article regarding unauthorized groundwater extraction in Aluva Municipality to support his case.

The Kerala Water Authority, represented by its Chairman, stated that it does not handle illegal groundwater extraction, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Kerala Ground Water (Control and Regulations) Act, 2002. The State's representatives highlighted that previous court judgments had already addressed the issue of illegal groundwater extraction and emphasized the need for compliance with existing laws and regulations.

The court acknowledged that while the KWA has no authority to act against illegal groundwater activities, the directions from a prior judgment (W.P.(C) No.31390 of 2018) were applicable to the current case. This earlier judgment mandated that state and local authorities ensure that commercial establishments do not exploit groundwater without proper permissions and that they conduct periodic inspections to enforce compliance with the law.

Ultimately, the court disposed of the writ petition, reiterating the need for adherence to the existing legal framework governing groundwater extraction and management, and directed the relevant authorities to take necessary actions as per the previous judgment.

No. 45 of 2022 registered at Ramabhadrapuram Police Station, Vizianagaram District. The F.I.R. charged him with offences under Section 269 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and various sections of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. 

The petitioner’s counsel argued that the case was similar to previous cases where the High Court had quashed several F.I.R.s based on identical facts, specifically referencing Criminal Petition Nos. 5421 of 2019 and others. The counsel further contended that in a related case (Crl.P.No.3731 of 2018), it was established that the police lacked jurisdiction to investigate offences under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and that the transport or storage of tobacco products did not constitute an offence under Sections 270 to 273 of the IPC.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor acknowledged that the current case was indeed covered by the earlier common order of the court and agreed to the quashing of the F.I.R. 

Consequently, the court, presided over by Justice D. Ramesh, allowed the Criminal Petition, quashing the F.I.R. against Thanga Turai Raju and ordered the return of the seized tobacco products to him.

**Case Number:** Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 762 of 2022  
**Petitioners:**

3. M/s Patna Offset Press (represented by Partner Amit Kumar Singh)

5. Dhanaraj Printing Press (represented by Proprietor Shahid Ahmad)  
**Respondents:**  
1. The Union of India (Ministry of Education)  
2. The State of Bihar (various officials)  
3. Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd. (TCIL)  

**Background:**  
The petitioners challenged the tender process initiated by the Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC) for procuring educational materials under the Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FL&N) scheme. They alleged that the tender conditions were tailored to exclude local printers and favor larger firms, particularly TCIL, which was ultimately awarded the contract.

**Key Issues Considered by the Court:**  
1. **Arbitrariness of the Tender Process:** Whether the centralized procurement process and the selection of the lowest tenderer were arbitrary and irrational.  
2. **Public Interest:** Whether the tender process affected public interest.  
3. **Legality of Actions:** Whether the actions of the Bihar Education Department officials in finalizing the tender were illegal.  
4. **Tailor-Made Conditions:** Whether the tender conditions were designed to favor certain bidders over others.  
5. **Nature of Procurement:** Whether the procurement of educational materials constituted goods or services under the Bihar Finance Rules.  
6. **Eligibility of Bidders:** Whether the successful bidders met the essential terms and conditions of the tender.  
7. **Malice and Favoritism:** Whether the actions of the respondents indicated malice or favoritism.  
8. **Joint Venture/Consortium Issues:** Whether TCIL's actions constituted a joint venture or consortium in violation of tender conditions.

**Court Findings:**  
- The court found that the tender process was not arbitrary and was conducted in a transparent manner, with multiple committees evaluating the bids.  
- The conditions set forth in the tender were deemed necessary for ensuring quality and expertise in the educational materials, which justified the higher financial turnover requirement.  
- The court ruled that the procurement was primarily for services, aligning with the objectives of the FL&N scheme, and thus the tender conditions were appropriate.  
- The court dismissed allegations of malice and favoritism, stating that the selection process was fair and based on objective criteria.  
- The court concluded that the actions of TCIL did not constitute a joint venture or consortium as defined in the tender conditions.

**Final Decision:**  
The Patna High Court dismissed the writ petition, upholding the tender process and the selection of TCIL as the successful bidder. The court emphasized the importance of public interest in education and the need for timely implementation of the FL&N scheme.

**Key Parties:**  
- **Appellant:** The Food Inspector, Medak District, represented by the Public Prosecutor  
- **Respondent:** Sri V. Prabhakar, S/o V. Ramulu  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around the acquittal of the respondent, Sri V. Prabhakar, who was charged under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 for selling adulterated sweets. The Food Inspector had inspected a shop owned by the respondent and found 40 sealed packets of Luna Sweet, suspecting them to be adulterated. The Inspector purchased three packets for analysis, which later confirmed the sweets were adulterated due to non-conformance with dye content standards. The trial court acquitted the respondent, leading to this appeal by the State.  

**Prosecution's Arguments:**  
1. The prosecution argued that it established the case beyond reasonable doubt, citing the Food Inspector's inspection, the purchase of the sweets, and the Public Analyst's report confirming adulteration.  
2. The prosecution contended that the trial court's reasons for acquittal were erroneous and unjustifiable, emphasizing the health risks posed by the adulterated sweets.  

**Defense's Arguments:**  
1. The defense highlighted that the mediator (PW.3) did not support the prosecution's case, claiming no seizure occurred in his presence and that the recovery panchanama was not drafted accordingly.  
2. The defense argued that the accused was not the manufacturer of the sweets and questioned why the manufacturer was not included as an accused party.  
3. The defense also pointed out that the accused was denied the opportunity to send the seized sweets for analysis to the Central Food Laboratory, which violated principles of natural justice.  

**Court's Analysis:**  
1. The court examined the timeline of events, noting significant delays in the prosecution's actions, particularly the 11-month gap before the complaint was filed and the notice issued under Section 13(2) of the Act.  
2. The court referenced legal provisions that require timely notification and opportunities for the accused to contest the findings, concluding that the accused's right to a fair trial was compromised.  
3. The court found that the prosecution's failure to array the manufacturer as an accused and the lack of support from the mediator cast doubt on the prosecution's credibility.  

**Conclusion:**  
The High Court upheld the trial court's acquittal of the respondent, finding no merit in the appeal. The judgment of the trial court was confirmed, and the appeal was dismissed, emphasizing the importance of due process and the rights of the accused in food safety cases.","HIGH COURT FOR THE STATE OF TELANGANA, HYDERABAD","['The Food Inspector, Medak District']","['V.Prabhakar, S/o V.Ramulu']",['Dr. CHILLAKUR SUMALATHA'],06-01-2022,[],"['Medak District', 'Jogipet', 'Telangana']","['Section 16(1)(a)(i) of Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954', 'Section 7(i) of Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954', 'Section 2(ia)(m) of Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954']","['Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954']",['Laborate Pharmaceuticals India Limited and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu (2018) 15 SCC 93'],"The accused was acquitted by the trial court for selling adulterated sweets.

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Commercial Division  
**Bench:** S.J. Kathawalla and Milind N. Jadhav  
**Case Numbers:** Commercial Appeal No. 108 of 2021 and Commercial Appeal No. 111 of 2021  

**Key Parties:**  
- **Appellant in Comm. Appeal No. 108 of 2021:** The Swedish Club  
- **Respondents in Comm. Appeal No. 108 of 2021:** V8 Pool Inc. and others  
- **Appellants in Comm. Appeal No. 111 of 2021:** Pradeep and others (Crew Members)  
- **Respondent in Comm. Appeal No. 111 of 2021:** m.t. GP ASPHALT I  

**Background:**  
The case revolves around the issue of whether crew wages accrued on board the vessel m.t. GP ASPHALT I after its arrest by the Admiralty Court should be classified as Sheriff's expenses. The vessel was arrested on December 22, 2020, and the crew had not been paid their wages since November 2020. The Swedish Club, as the Protection and Indemnity Club for the vessel, sought to make payments for the crew's wages and maintenance, claiming these should be treated as Sheriff's expenses.

**Judgment Overview:**  
1. **Crew Wages as Sheriff's Expenses:**  
   - The court examined whether the crew wages accrued post-arrest could be classified as Sheriff's expenses. The Ld. Single Judge had previously disallowed the crew's application for their wages to be treated as such, stating they could file a suit to prove their claims.
   - The Swedish Club argued that it had a right to recover the wages it paid to the crew as Sheriff's expenses, citing the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) and Rule 1084 of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules.

2. **Swedish Club's Obligations:**  
   - The Ld. Single Judge had ruled that the Swedish Club was obligated under the MLC to pay the crew's wages and thus could not claim reimbursement as Sheriff's expenses. The court noted that if the Swedish Club made payments post-arrest, it would need to file a suit to recover those amounts.
   - The Swedish Club contended that it acted promptly to fulfill its humanitarian obligations under the MLC and that it should be allowed to stand in the shoes of the crew after making payments.

3. **Crew Members' Claims:**  
   - The Crew Members, represented by Pradeep and others, sought to recover wages accrued from March 1, 2021, to March 20, 2021, as Sheriff's expenses. They argued that their presence on the vessel during the arrest entitled them to wages, regardless of their duties.
   - The court acknowledged that the crew had been retained on board as per safe manning requirements and were entitled to their wages.

4. **Court's Findings:**  
   - The court found that the Swedish Club had acted in good faith and promptly sought leave from the Admiralty Court to make payments for the crew's benefit. It ruled that the crew's wages accrued post-arrest should be treated as Sheriff's expenses.
   - The court also determined that the Swedish Club was entitled to recover the wages it paid to the crew as Sheriff's expenses, as it had acted under the MLC and sought court approval before making payments.

5. **Final Decision:**  
   - The court allowed both appeals:  
     a. The Crew Members were entitled to payment of USD 11,133.31 for wages from March 1 to March 20, 2021, as Sheriff's expenses.  
     b. The Swedish Club was entitled to payment of USD 64,663 for wages accrued from December 22, 2020, to February 28, 2021, as Sheriff's expenses.  
     c. The Swedish Club was also granted the status of a maritime lien for payments made prior to the vessel's arrest.

**Guidelines Established:**  
The court established guidelines for handling cases of abandoned vessels under arrest, emphasizing the need for prompt action by the Admiralty Court to ensure the well-being of crew members and the preservation of the vessel. It clarified that parties wishing to incur expenses for the crew's maintenance or wages should approach the court or the Sheriff for necessary approvals.",HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY,"['The Swedish Club', 'Pradeep and others']","['V8 Pool Inc.', 'm.t.

**Court:** Patna High Court  
**Date:** February 9, 2022  
**Judgment Author:** Justice Ashutosh Kumar  
**Case Numbers:** Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 89 of 2021 and No. 157 of 2021  
**Key Parties:**  
- **Petitioner:** United Breweries Limited, represented by Amarish Kumar Singh (General Works Manager)  
- **Respondents:** The State of Bihar, including various officials such as the Principal Secretary of Registration, Excise and Prohibition, and the Superintendent of Police, Madhubani.  
- **Additional Petitioner in Case No. 157:** Mukesh Kumar, proprietor of M/s. Ma Enterprises, Madhubani.  

**Background:**  
The case arose from an FIR registered on October 14, 2020, alleging violations of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on the seizure of 24 bottles of a non-alcoholic beverage (Kingfisher Ultra) that were claimed to contain ethyl alcohol exceeding permissible limits. The police had seized these bottles from an individual named Jiwach Kumar, who stated they belonged to Shankar Santhalia, who in turn purchased them from Mukesh Kumar's enterprise.  

**Key Arguments:**  
1. **Petitioner's Defense:**  
   - United Breweries argued that they manufacture non-alcoholic beverages in compliance with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and have the necessary licenses from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).  
   - They contended that the beverage in question was non-alcoholic, containing less than 0.5% ethyl alcohol, and thus did not constitute an intoxicant under the law.  
   - The petitioner highlighted discrepancies in the chemical analysis conducted by the Excise Department, which reported 0.8% alcohol content, arguing that this was inconsistent with tests conducted by accredited laboratories that reported zero alcohol content.  
   - They also pointed out that the prosecution was based solely on the report of one chemical examiner, which they claimed was flawed and did not follow proper testing protocols.  

2. **Legal Precedents:**  
   - The petitioner referenced a previous case (M/s. Smart India Marketing Vs State of Bihar) where the court quashed similar charges against a manufacturer of non-alcoholic beverages, emphasizing that the law does not prohibit the sale of non-alcoholic drinks conforming to BIS standards.  
   - They argued that the prosecution did not meet the necessary legal threshold for establishing an offence under the Prohibition Act, as the beverages were not sold or consumed for intoxication.  

**Court's Findings:**  
- The court noted that the prosecution's basis for the FIR was insufficient, as the beverages in question were not intended for intoxication and did not meet the legal definition of intoxicants.  
- The court emphasized that minor variations in alcohol content in non-alcoholic beverages should not lead to criminal prosecution, as this would contradict the purpose of the Prohibition Act, which aims to prevent the sale of intoxicants.  
- The court found that the prosecution had not demonstrated any intent on the part of the petitioner to violate the law, and the evidence presented did not substantiate the charges.

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Patna  
**Date:** 9 February 2022  
**Judgment Author:** Justice Ashutosh Kumar  
**Case Number:** Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 366 of 2021  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioner:** United Breweries Limited, represented by Amarish Kumar Singh, General Works Manager.  
- **Respondents:** 1. The State of Bihar through the Principal Secretary, Registration, Excise and Prohibition, Govt. of Bihar  
2. The Excise Commissioner, Bihar  
3. The District Magistrate cum Collector, Madhubani  
4. The Superintendent of Police, Madhubani  
5. The Station House Officer, Pandaul PS, Madhubani  

**Background:**  
United Breweries Limited, a company engaged in the manufacture of non-alcoholic beverages, challenged the prosecution initiated against it under various sections of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, and the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution stemmed from a report indicating that a sample of their product contained 0.8% ethyl alcohol, exceeding the permissible limit for non-alcoholic beverages (0.5% as per Bureau of Indian Standards).  

**Arguments by the Petitioner:**  
1. **No Intoxicant Produced:** The petitioner argued that it has never manufactured or sold any intoxicant or liquor as defined under the Excise Act. The beverages produced are non-alcoholic, containing less than 0.5% ethyl alcohol, and are compliant with FSSAI regulations.  
2. **Testing Discrepancies:** The petitioner contested the validity of the chemical examination report from the Excise Department, claiming it was incorrect and did not follow the prescribed testing methods. They provided evidence from multiple accredited laboratories confirming zero alcohol content in their products.  
3. **Legal Precedent:** The petitioner cited a previous case (M/s. Smart India Marketing Vs State of Bihar) where the court quashed similar charges against a company producing non-alcoholic beverages, emphasizing that the Prohibition Act does not apply to products conforming to BIS standards.  
4. **Lack of Intention to Intoxicate:** The petitioner argued that even if the product contained more than 0.5% alcohol, it was not consumed for intoxication, which is a necessary condition for prosecution under the Act.  

**Court's Findings:**  
1. **Prosecution Lacks Basis:** The court found that the prosecution was initiated based solely on a solitary report from the Excise Department, which was not substantiated by proper testing protocols.  
2. **No Offence Established:** The court held that the allegations did not prima facie constitute any offence as the products were not sold or consumed as intoxicants.  
3. **Margin of Error:** The court acknowledged the inherent margin of error in alcohol testing and noted that the prosecution did not consider alternative explanations for the reported alcohol content.  

**Final Decision:**  
The High Court quashed the FIR against United Breweries Limited and all subsequent prosecutions arising from it, allowing the petition. The court emphasized the need for strict adherence to testing standards and the importance of intent in determining the applicability of the Prohibition Act.",Patna High Court,['United Breweries Limited'],"['The State Of Bihar Through The Principal Secretary, Registration, Excise and Prohibition, Govt. of Bihar, Patna', 'The Excise Commissioner, Bihar, Patna', 'The District Magistrate Cum Collector, Madhubani Bihar', 'The Superintendent of Police, Madhubani Bihar', 'The Station House Officer, Pandaul PS, Madhubani Bihar']",['Ashutosh Kumar'],09-02-2022,"['United Breweries Limited', 'Food Safety and Standards Authority of India', 'Bureau of Indian Standards', 'CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore', 'Intertek India Private Limited', 'Vimta']","['Bihar', 'Lucknow', 'Patna', 'Madhubani']","['Section 30(a) of Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016', 'Section 35(e) of Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016', 'Section 272 of Indian Penal Code', 'Section 273 of Indian Penal Code', 'Section 465 of Indian Penal Code', 'Section 420 of Indian Penal Code']","['Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016', 'Indian Penal Code']","['M/s.

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench  
**Date:** 13 January 2022  
**Judge:** Avinash G. Gharote  
**Case Number:** Criminal Application (BA) No. 1339/2021  
  
**Key Parties:**  
- **Applicant:** Vijaysing @ Dnyaneshwar @ Gotya Raghunandan Pawar  
- **Respondent:** State of Maharashtra, represented by the Officer in Charge of Police Station  
  
**Background:**  
The applicant was arrested on 25 November 2021 in connection with Crime No. 221/2021 for multiple offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The charges included Sections 188, 272, 273, and 328 of the IPC, as well as various sections of the Food Safety Act related to the illegal transport of Ghutka, a tobacco product. The arrest followed a police operation where the applicant was found transporting Ghutka worth Rs. 22,000 on his motorcycle.  
  
**Arguments Presented:**  
- **For the Applicant:**  
  - The applicant's counsel, Mr. H.R. Gadhia, argued that the nature of the offense did not warrant continued incarceration, especially since the applicant had been in custody since 26 November 2021.  
  - He contended that Section 328 of the IPC may not apply, referencing a previous case (Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao v. State of Maharashtra) to support his argument.  
  
- **For the State:**  
  - The State's representative, Mr. I. Damle, opposed the bail application, emphasizing the serious public health implications of the applicant's actions.  
  - He highlighted that the production, sale, and transport of Ghutka are prohibited in Maharashtra due to its harmful health effects, including links to oral cancer.  
  - The State argued that the applicant's refusal to disclose the source of the contraband indicated a likelihood of reoffending if released.  
  
**Judgment:**  
The court dismissed the bail application, citing the following key points:  
1. **Public Health Concerns:** The court acknowledged the significant health risks associated with Ghutka, referencing scientific studies that link its consumption to oral cancer and other serious health issues.  
2. **Legal Prohibitions:** The court noted the strict prohibitions under the Food Safety and Standards Act, which impose severe penalties for the transport of contraband food products.  
3. **Risk of Reoffending:** The applicant's non-cooperation with the investigation and refusal to disclose the source of the contraband raised concerns about the potential for continued illegal activities if released on bail.  
4. **Judicial Precedents:** The court considered previous judgments that recognized the harmful effects of Ghutka and the necessity of strict enforcement of laws prohibiting its transport.  
  
**Conclusion:**  
The court concluded that the applicant's release on bail would not serve the public interest, given the serious health implications of his actions and the ongoing issues with the illegal transport of Ghutka in Maharashtra. The application for bail was therefore denied.","High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench",['Vijaysing @ Dnyaneshwar @ Gotya Raghunandan Pawar'],['State of Maharashtra'],['Avinash G.

Case No. 13 of 2021, which involved multiple alleged offences including sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, among others. The case was presided over by Justice S.K. Sahoo in the High Court of Orissa on February 9, 2022.

The petitioner was represented by Mr. P.K. Nayak, while the State was represented by Mr. D.K. Pani, Additional Standing Counsel. The court reviewed the First Information Report (F.I.R.) and considered the arguments presented by both parties. Notably, the petitioner had deposited a compounding fee of Rs. 30,000 before the Senior Inspector/Inspector of Legal Metrology on January 11, 2021, which was acknowledged in the application.

After examining the submissions and the test report provided by the State's counsel, the court decided to make the interim order dated April 13, 2021, absolute. The conditions attached to this order required the petitioner to be available for interrogation by the Investigating Officer (I.O.) as needed, and to refrain from any actions that could influence witnesses or dissuade them from providing information related to the case.

The court emphasized that any violation of these conditions could lead to the cancellation of the bail granted. Consequently, the anticipatory bail application was disposed of, and the petitioner was granted bail under the specified conditions.

The applicant, Vishnu Gupta, had been in custody since January 22, 2021, related to Crime No. 80/2021 at P.S. Ranjhi, District Jabalpur, facing charges under Sections 420 and 272 of the IPC, as well as Sections 51, 52, and 26(2)(ii) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. 

The allegations against Gupta included the stocking and selling of artificial ghee, which was a mixture of Vanaspati ghee and soybean oil, with the intent to deceive the public for illegal profit. The applicant's counsel argued for his innocence, claiming he was falsely implicated, and noted that the majority of the charges were bailable. The counsel also referenced the Supreme Court's guidelines from the case of Arnesh Kumar vs. State of Bihar, asserting that these guidelines were not followed in Gupta's arrest. 

The Panel Lawyer for the State countered that Gupta was a habitual offender with six prior cases against him, two of which were for similar offenses, and that proceedings under the National Security Act had been initiated against him. The court noted the substantial quantity of ghee and related materials recovered from Gupta's possession, indicating a significant operation that could harm public health. 

The court found sufficient prima facie evidence against Gupta under Section 415 of the IPC, which relates to cheating, and determined that the circumstances had not changed since the previous bail application was denied. Given the gravity of the offenses and the potential risk to public health, the court concluded that it was not appropriate to grant bail.

**Court:** High Court of Judicature at Madras  
**Date:** 01 February 2022  
**Judgment Author:** Justice M. Nirmal Kumar  
**Case Number:** Crl.O.P.No.1828 of 2022  
  
**Parties Involved:**  
- **Petitioner:** V.Balakrishnan, Proprietor of Kadavul Mixture Company  
- **Respondents:**  
  1. The State represented by the Food Safety Officer, Coimbatore District  
  2. Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drugs Administration Department  
  
**Background:**  
The petitioner, V.Balakrishnan, sought to quash the proceedings in STC.No.1561 of 2018, which were initiated against him following an inspection of his food business on 08 May 2017. During this inspection, four sample packs of a mixture were collected by the Food Safety Officer and sent for analysis. The analysis report was received on 17 August 2017, indicating that the samples contained an unsafe additive, Tartrazine, which was not permitted under the applicable food safety regulations.  
  
**Key Arguments:**  
1. **Violation of Timelines:** The petitioner’s counsel argued that the analysis of the samples was conducted beyond the 14-day limit stipulated in Section 42(2) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The samples were analyzed between 03 August 2017 and 17 August 2017, which was a clear violation of the law.  
2. **Limitation Period for Filing Complaints:** The petitioner contended that the complaint against him was filed beyond the one-year limitation period set by Section 77 of the Act. The inspection occurred on 08 May 2017, but the complaint was filed on 18 June 2018, which exceeded the statutory limit.  
3. **Prosecution Recommendation Delay:** The recommendation for prosecution from the Designated Officer was made almost a year after the analysis report was received, further complicating the legality of the proceedings.  
  
**Respondents' Position:** The Additional Public Prosecutor argued that the issues raised by the petitioner should be addressed during the trial rather than in a quash petition. The prosecution maintained that the samples were found to be unsafe due to the presence of an unauthorized coloring agent, thus justifying the complaint.  
  
**Court's Findings:**  
The court reviewed the timelines and procedures followed in the case. It noted that:  
- The analysis of the samples was indeed conducted beyond the 14-day period, violating Section 42(2) of the Act.  
- The complaint was filed after the one-year limitation period, violating Section 77 of the Act.  
- The delay in forwarding the prosecution recommendation also contributed to the case being legally untenable.  
  
**Final Decision:**  
The High Court concluded that the continuation of the proceedings against V.Balakrishnan would amount to an abuse of the process of law. Consequently, the court quashed the proceedings in STC.No.1561 of 2018, allowing the Criminal Original Petition.

The petitioners, Konto Warisa and the legal heirs of the deceased Golom Nunisa, sought justice for the alleged extrajudicial killings and compensation of Rs. 20 lakhs each.

### Key Parties:
- **Petitioners:** Sri Konto Warisa and the legal heirs of Sri Golom Nunisa (Smt. Sopola Nunisa and Sri Kombo Nunisa).
- **Respondents:** The Union of India, represented by various officials including the Secretary to the Government of India, the Group Commandant of the 12th Battalion Madras Regiment, and local district officials.

### Background:
The petitioners alleged that their sons were picked up by army personnel on July 14, 2009, tortured, and subsequently killed. An FIR was lodged, but no action was taken against the army personnel, prompting the petitioners to seek a judicial inquiry.

### Judicial Inquiry Findings:
The court ordered a judicial inquiry, which concluded that:
1. The operation conducted by the army was illegal and without jurisdiction, as no police personnel were involved.
2. Both deceased had no criminal background and were not associated with any extremist groups.
3. The deceased were tortured, as evidenced by the post-mortem reports showing multiple injuries consistent with torture.
4. The army's claim that the deaths occurred during a retaliatory encounter was deemed unbelievable, as the deceased were in custody and unable to pose a threat.
5. The injuries sustained by the army personnel were not consistent with a gunshot wound, contradicting the army's narrative.
6. The deaths were classified as cold-blooded killings by the army personnel.

### Court's Decision:
The court upheld the findings of the inquiry and ruled that the army personnel were responsible for the unlawful deaths of Poresh Warisa and Sujit Nunisa. The court awarded Rs. 20 lakhs each to the petitioners, totaling Rs. 40 lakhs, to be paid by the Union of India and the army. The court emphasized the need for accountability and the protection of fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution.

### Conclusion:
The judgment highlighted the importance of upholding human rights and the rule of law, particularly in cases involving state actors. The court refrained from directing specific punitive actions against the army personnel, leaving it to the army's discretion to address the findings of the inquiry.","The Gauhati High Court (High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh)","['Sri Konto Warisa', 'Smt.
